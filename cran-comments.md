## Overview

**tinyplot** v0.3.0 is a major release with many new features, including a
revamped type processing system, support for additional plot types, and a new
plotting theme framework.

As per our earlier submissions, we continue to run a comprehensive test suite
comprising hundreds of test snapshots (i.e., SVG images) as part of our CI
development workflow. See:
https://github.com/grantmcdermott/tinyplot/tree/main/inst/tinytest/_tinysnapshot
However, we have removed these test snapshots from our CRAN submission to reduce
the size of of install target and stay within CRAN's recommend size limits.
