## Overview

**tinyplot** v0.4.0 is a minor release that introduces several new features
and addresses a variety of bugs.

As per our earlier submissions, we continue to run a comprehensive test suite
comprising hundreds of test snapshots (i.e., SVG images) as part of our CI
development workflow. See:
https://github.com/grantmcdermott/tinyplot/tree/main/inst/tinytest/_tinysnapshot
However, we have removed these test snapshots from our CRAN submission to reduce
the size of of install target and stay within CRAN's recommend size limits.
