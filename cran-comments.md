P.S. We continue to run a comprehensive test suite comprising hundreds of test
snapshots (i.e., SVG images) as part of our CI development workflow. See:
https://github.com/grantmcdermott/tinyplot/tree/main/inst/tinytest/_tinysnapshot
However, we have removed these test snapshots from our CRAN submission to reduce
the size of of install target and stay within CRAN's recommend size limits.
