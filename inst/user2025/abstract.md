The {tinyplot} package provides a lightweight extension of the base R graphics
system. It aims to pair the concise syntax and flexibility of base R plotting,
with the convenience features pioneered by newer ({grid}-based) visualization
packages like {ggplot2} and {lattice}. This includes the ability to plot grouped
data with automatic legends and/or facets, advanced visualization types, and
easy customization via ready-made themes.

This talk will provide an introduction to {tinyplot} in the form of various
plotting examples, describe its motivating use-cases, and also contrast its
advantages (and disadvantages) compared to other R visualization libraries.
The package is available on CRAN.
