\title{Dodge positions for grouped data}
\usage{
dodge_positions(
  datapoints,
  dodge,
  fixed.pos = TRUE,
  cols = c("x", "xmin", "xmax")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{datapoints}{Data frame containing plot data with at least \code{x} and \code{by}
columns.}

\item{dodge}{Numeric value specifying the dodge amount. If 0, no dodging is
performed.}

\item{fixed.pos}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, dodge positions are fixed based on the
number of groups in \code{by}. If \code{FALSE}, dodge positions are calculated
separately for each unique x value.}

\item{cols}{Character vector of column names to dodge. Defaults to
\code{c("x", "xmin", "xmax")}.}
}
\value{
Modified \code{datapoints} data frame with dodged positions.
}
\description{
Adjusts x-coordinates (and optionally xmin/xmax) to dodge overlapping points
or ranges in grouped plots.
}
\details{
When \code{fixed.pos = TRUE}, all groups are dodged by the same amount across all
x values, which is useful when x is categorical. When \code{fixed.pos = FALSE},
dodging is calculated independently for each x value, which is useful when
the number of groups varies across x values.
