\title{Dodge positions for grouped data}
\usage{
dodge_positions(
  datapoints,
  dodge,
  fixed.pos = TRUE,
  cols = NULL,
  settings = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{datapoints}{Data frame containing plot data with at least \code{x} and \code{by}
columns.}

\item{dodge}{Numeric value in the range \verb{[0,1)}, or logical. If numeric,
values are scaled relative to x-axis break spacing (e.g., \code{dodge = 0.1}
places outermost groups one-tenth of the way to adjacent breaks;
\code{dodge = 0.5} places them midway between breaks; etc.). Values < 0.5 are
recommended. If \code{TRUE}, dodge width is calculated automatically based on
the number of groups (0.1 per group for 2-4 groups, 0.45 for 5+ groups). If
\code{FALSE} or 0, no dodging is performed. Default is 0.}

\item{fixed.pos}{Logical indicating whether dodged groups should retain a
fixed relative position based on their group value. Relevant for \code{x}
categories that only have a subset of the total number of groups. Defaults
to \code{FALSE}, in which case dodging is based on the number of unique groups
present in that \code{x} category alone. See Examples.}

\item{cols}{Character vector of column names to dodge. If \code{NULL} (default),
automatically detects and dodges \code{x}, \code{xmin}, and \code{xmax} if they exist.}

\item{settings}{Environment containing plot settings. If \code{NULL} (default),
retrieved from the calling environment.}
}
\value{
Modified \code{datapoints} data frame with dodged positions.
}
\description{
Adjusts x-coordinates (and optionally xmin/xmax) to dodge overlapping points
or ranges in grouped plots.
}
\details{
When \code{fixed.pos = TRUE}, all groups are dodged by the same amount across all
x values, which is useful when x is categorical. When \code{fixed.pos = FALSE},
dodging is calculated independently for each x value, which is useful when
the number of groups varies across x values.

If \code{cols} is not specified, the function automatically dodges \code{x} and any
\code{xmin}/\code{xmax} columns that exist in the data.
