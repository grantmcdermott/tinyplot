\title{Draw multiple legends with automatic positioning}
\usage{
draw_multi_legend(legend_list, position = "right!")
}
\arguments{
\item{legend_list}{A list of legend arguments, where each element is itself a
list of arguments that can be passed on to \link{draw_legend}. Legends will be
drawn vertically (top to bottom) in the order that they are provided. Note
that we currently only support dual legends, i.e. the top-level list has a
maximum length of 2.}

\item{position}{String indicating the base keyword position for the
multi-legend. Currently only \code{"right!"} and \code{"left!"} are supported.}
}
\value{
No return value, called for side effect of drawing multiple legends.
}
\description{
Internal function to draw multiple legends (e.g., bubble + color)
with automatic dimension calculation and positioning. This function handles
the internal gymnastics of required to determine the individual legend
dimensions, before drawing them in the optimal order and position.
