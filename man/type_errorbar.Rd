\title{Error bar and pointrange plot types}
\usage{
type_errorbar(length = 0.05, dodge = 0, fixed.dodge = FALSE)

type_pointrange(dodge = 0, fixed.dodge = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{length}{length of the edges of the arrow head (in inches).}

\item{dodge}{Adjustment parameter for dodging overlapping points or ranges in
grouped plots along the x-axis (or y-axis for flipped plots). Either:
\itemize{
\item numeric value in the range \verb{[0,1)}. Note that values are scaled
relative to the spacing of x-axis breaks, e.g. \code{dodge = 0.1} places the
outermost groups one-tenth of the way to adjacent breaks, \code{dodge = 0.5}
places them midway between breaks, etc. Values < 0.5 are recommended.
\item logical. If \code{TRUE}, the dodge width is calculated automatically based on
the number of groups (0.1 per group for 2-4 groups, 0.45 for 5+ groups). If
\code{FALSE} or 0, no dodging is performed.
}

Default value is 0 (no dodging). While we do not check, it is \emph{strongly}
recommended that dodging only be used in cases where the x-axis comprises a
limited number of discrete breaks.}

\item{fixed.dodge}{Logical. If \code{FALSE} (default), dodge positions are
calculated independently for each \code{x} value, based only on the groups
present at that position. If \code{TRUE}, dodge positions are based on all
groups, ensuring "fixed" spacing across x-axis breaks (i.e., even if some
groups are missing for a particular \code{x} value).}
