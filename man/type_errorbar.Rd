\title{Error bar and pointrange plot types}
\usage{
type_errorbar(length = 0.05, dodge = 0, fixed.pos = FALSE)

type_pointrange(dodge = 0, fixed.pos = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{length}{length of the edges of the arrow head (in inches).}

\item{dodge}{Numeric value in the range \verb{[0,1)}, or logical. If numeric,
values are scaled relative to x-axis break spacing (e.g., \code{dodge = 0.1}
places outermost groups one-tenth of the way to adjacent breaks;
\code{dodge = 0.5} places them midway between breaks; etc.). Values < 0.5 are
recommended. If \code{TRUE}, dodge width is calculated automatically based on
the number of groups (0.1 per group for 2-4 groups, 0.45 for 5+ groups). If
\code{FALSE} or 0, no dodging is performed. Default is 0.}

\item{fixed.pos}{Logical indicating whether dodged groups should retain a
fixed relative position based on their group value. Relevant for \code{x}
categories that only have a subset of the total number of groups. Defaults
to \code{FALSE}, in which case dodging is based on the number of unique groups
present in that \code{x} category alone. See Examples.}
