\usage{
type_loess(
  span = 0.75,
  degree = 2,
  family = "gaussian",
  control = stats::loess.control(),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{span}{the parameter \eqn{\alpha} which controls the degree of
    smoothing.}

\item{degree}{the degree of the polynomials to be used, normally 1 or
    2. (Degree 0 is also allowed, but see the \sQuote{Note}.)}

\item{family}{if \code{"gaussian"} fitting is by least-squares, and if
    \code{"symmetric"} a re-descending M estimator is used with Tukey's
    biweight function.  Can be abbreviated.}

\item{control}{control parameters: see \code{\link[stats]{loess.control}}.}

\item{...}{control parameters can also be supplied directly
    (\emph{if} \code{control} is not specified).}
