\usage{
type_area(alpha = NULL)

type_ribbon(alpha = NULL, dodge = 0, fixed.pos = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the opacity of ribbon shading
If no \code{alpha} value is provided, then will default to \code{tpar("ribbon.alpha")}
(i.e., probably \code{0.2} unless this has been overridden by the user in their global
settings.)}

\item{dodge}{Numeric value (>= 0) for dodging of overlapping \code{by} groups.
Dodging is scaled relative to the x-axis tick locations (i.e., unique
levels of \code{x}). For example, \code{dodge = 0.5} would place the outermost dodged
groups exactly midway the between axis ticks. Default value is 0 (no
dodging).}

\item{fixed.pos}{Logical indicating whether dodged groups should retain a
fixed relative position based on their group value. Relevant for \code{x}
categories that only have a subset of the total number of groups. Defaults
to \code{FALSE}, in which case dodging is based on the number of unique groups
present in that \code{x} category alone. See Examples.}
}
\description{
Type constructor functions for producing polygon ribbons, which
define a \code{y} interval (usually spanning from \code{ymin} to \code{ymax}) for each
\code{x} value. Area plots are a special case of ribbon plot where \code{ymin} is
set to 0 and \code{ymax} is set to \code{y}.

\section{Dodging ribbon plots}{


We support dodging for grouped ribbon plots, enabling similar functionality
to dodged errorbar and pointrange plots. However, it is strongly recommended
that dodging is only implemented for cases where the x-axis comprises a
limited number of discrete cases (e.g., coefficient or event-study plots).
See Examples.

#
## Ribbon plots

# "ribbon" convenience string
tinyplot(x = x, ymin = y - 1, ymax = y + 1, type = "ribbon")
# Same result with type_ribbon()
tinyplot(x = x, ymin = y-1, ymax = y+1, type = type_ribbon())

# y will be added as a line if it is specified
tinyplot(x = x, y = y, ymin = y-1, ymax = y+1, type = "ribbon")

#
## Area plots

# "area" type convenience string
tinyplot(x, y, type = "area")

# Same result with type_area()
tinyplot(x, y, type = type_area())

# Area plots are often used for time series charts
tinyplot(AirPassengers, type = "area")

#
## Dodged ribbon/area plots

# Dodged ribbon or area plots can be useful in cases where there is strong
# overlap across groups (and a limited number of discrete x-axis values).
