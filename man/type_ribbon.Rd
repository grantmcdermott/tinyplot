\usage{
type_area()

type_ribbon()
}
\description{
Type constructor functions for producing polygon ribbons, which
define a \code{y} interval (usually spanning from \code{ymin} to \code{ymax}) for each
\code{x} value. Area plots are a special case of ribbon plot where \code{ymin} is
set to 0 and \code{ymax} is set to \code{y}.
}
\examples{
x = 1:100/10
y = sin(x)

#
## Ribbon plots

# "ribbon" convenience string
tinyplot(x = x, ymin = y-1, ymax = y+1, type = "ribbon")
# Same result with type_ribbon()
tinyplot(x = x, ymin = y-1, ymax = y+1, type = type_ribbon())

# y will be added as a line if it is specified
tinyplot(x = x, y = y, ymin = y-1, ymax = y+1, type = "ribbon")

#
## Area plots
  
# "area" type convenience string
tinyplot(x, y, type = "area")

# Same result with type_area()
tinyplot(x, y, type = type_area())

# Area plots are often used for time series charts
tinyplot(AirPassengers, type = "area")
