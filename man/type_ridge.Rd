}
\arguments{
\item{scale}{Numeric. Controls the scaling factor of each plot.
Values greater than 1 means that plots overlap.}

\item{joint.max}{character indicating how to scale the maximum of the densities:
The default \code{"all"} indicates that all densities are scaled jointly relative to
the same maximum so that the areas of all densities are comparable.
Alternatively, \code{"facet"} indicates that the maximum is computed within
each facet so that the areas of the densities are comparable within each
facet but not necessarily across facets. Finally, \code{"by"} indicates that
each row (in each facet) is scaled separately, so that the areas of the
densities for \code{by} groups in the same row are comparable but not necessarily
across rows.}

\item{breaks}{Numeric. If a color gradient is used for shading, the
breaks between the colors can be modified. The default is to use
equidistant breaks spanning the range of the \code{x} variable.}

\item{probs}{Numeric. Instead of specifying the same \code{breaks} on the
x-axis for all groups, it is possible to specify group-specific quantiles
at the specified \code{probs}. The quantiles are computed based on the density
(rather than the raw original variable). Only one of \code{breaks} or
\code{probs} must be specified.}

\item{ylevels}{a character or numeric vector specifying in which order
the levels of the y-variable should be plotted.}

\item{bw}{the smoothing bandwidth to be used.  The kernels are scaled
    such that this is the standard deviation of the smoothing kernel.
    (Note this differs from the reference books cited below.)

    \code{bw} can also be a character string giving a rule to choose the
    bandwidth.  See \code{\link[stats]{bw.nrd}}. \cr The default,
    \code{"nrd0"}, has remained the default for historical and
    compatibility reasons, rather than as a general recommendation,
    where e.g., \code{"SJ"} would rather fit, see also
    Venables and Ripley (2002).

    The specified (or computed) value of \code{bw} is multiplied by
    \code{adjust}.
  }

\item{joint.bw}{character string indicating whether (and how) the smoothing
bandwidth should be computed from the joint data distribution. The default of
\code{"mean"} will compute the joint bandwidth as the mean of the individual
subgroup bandwidths (weighted by their number of observations). Choosing \code{"full"} will result in a
joint bandwidth computed from the full distribution (merging all subgroups).
For \code{"none"} the individual bandwidth will be computed independently for
each subgroup. See \code{\link{type_density}} for some discussion of
practical considerations.}

\item{adjust}{the bandwidth used is actually \code{adjust*bw}.
    This makes it easy to specify values like \sQuote{half the default}
    bandwidth.}

\item{kernel}{a character string giving the smoothing kernel to be used. This
must partially match one of \code{"gaussian"}, \code{"rectangular"}, \code{"triangular"},
\code{"epanechnikov"}, \code{"biweight"}, \code{"cosine"} or \code{"optcosine"}, with default
\code{"gaussian"}, and may be abbreviated to a unique prefix (single letter).

\code{"cosine"} is smoother than \code{"optcosine"}, which is the usual 'cosine'
kernel in the literature and almost MSE-efficient. However, \code{"cosine"} is
the version used by S.}

\item{n}{the number of equally spaced points at which the density is
    to be estimated.  When \code{n > 512}, it is rounded up to a power
    of 2 during the calculations (as \code{\link[stats]{fft}} is used) and the
    final result is interpolated by \code{\link[stats]{approx}}.  So it almost
    always makes sense to specify \code{n} as a power of two.
  }

\item{gradient}{Logical or character. Should a gradient fill be used to
shade the area under the density? If a character specification is used,
then it can either be of length 1 and specify the palette to be used with
\code{gradient = TRUE} corresponding to \code{gradient = "viridis"}. If a character
vector of length greater than 1 is used, then it should specify the
colors in the palette, e.g., \code{gradient = hcl.colors(512)}.}

\item{raster}{Logical. Should the \code{gradient} fill be drawn using
\code{\link[graphics]{rasterImage}}? Defaults to \code{FALSE}, in which case the
\code{gradient} fill will instead be drawn using
\code{\link[graphics]{polygon}}. See the \verb{Technical note on gradient fills}
section below.}

\item{col}{Character string denoting the outline (border) color for all
of the ridge densities. Note that a singular value is expected; if multiple
colors are provided then only the first will be used. This argument is mostly
useful for the aesthetic effect of drawing a common outline color in
combination with gradient fills. See Examples.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric in the range \verb{[0,1]} for adjusting the alpha
transparency of the density fills. In most cases, will default to a value of
1, i.e. fully opaque. But for some \code{by} grouped plots (excepting the special
cases where \code{by==y} or \code{by==x}), will default to 0.6.}
}
\description{
Type function for producing ridge plots (also known as joy plots),
which display density distributions for multiple groups with vertical offsets.
This function uses \code{tinyplot} scaffolding, which enables added functionality
such as grouping and faceting.

The line color is controlled by the \code{col} argument in the \code{tinyplot()} call.
The fill color is controlled by the \code{bg} argument in the \code{tinyplot()} call.

\section{Technical note on gradient fills}{


\code{tinyplot} uses two basic approaches for drawing gradient fills in ridge line
plots, e.g., if \code{type_ridge(gradient = TRUE)}.

The first (and default) polygon-based approach involves dividing up the main
density region into many smaller polygons along the x-axis. Each of these
smaller polygons inherits a different color "segment" from the underlying
palette swatch, which in turn creates the effect of a continuous gradient
when they are all plotted together. Internally, this polygon-based approach
is vectorized (i.e., all of the sub-polygons are plotted simultaneously). It
is thus efficient from a plotting perspective and generally also performs
well from an aesthetic perspective. However, it can occasionally produce
undesirable plotting artifacts on some graphics devices---e.g., thin but
visible vertical lines---if alpha transparency is being used at the same
time.

For this reason, we also offer an alternative raster-based approach for
gradient fills that users can invoke via
\code{type_ridge(gradient = TRUE, raster = TRUE)}. The essential idea is that we
coerce the density polygon into a raster representation (using
\code{\link[graphics]{rasterImage}}) and achieve the gradient effect via
color interpolation. The trade-off this time is potential smoothness
artifacts around the top of the ridge densities at high resolutions, since we
have converted a vector object into a raster object.

Again, we expect that the choice between these two approaches will only
matter for ridge plots that combine gradient fills with alpha transparency
(and on certain graphics devices). We recommend that users experiment to
determine which approach is optimal for their device.

\examples{
## default ridge plot (using the "ridge" convenience string)
tinyplot(Species ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris, type = "ridge")

## pass customization arguments through type_ridge(), for example...

## use the same bandwidth for all densities
tinyplot(Species ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris,
  type = type_ridge(bw = bw.nrd0(iris$Sepal.Width)))

## customized ridge plot without overlap of densities
tinyplot(Species ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris,
  type = type_ridge(scale = 1),
  bg = "light blue", col = "black")
  
## by grouping is also supported. two special cases of interest:

# 1) by == y (color by y groups)
tinyplot(Species ~ Sepal.Width | Species, data = iris, type = "ridge")

# 2) by == x (gradient coloring along x)
tinyplot(Species ~ Sepal.Width | Sepal.Width, data = iris, type = "ridge")

# aside: pass explicit `type_ridge(col = <col>)` arg to set a common border
# color
tinyplot(Species ~ Sepal.Width | Sepal.Width, data = iris,
  type = type_ridge(col = "white"))

## gradient coloring along the x-axis can also be invoked manually without
## a legend (the following tinyplot calls are all equivalent)
tinyplot(Species ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris, type = type_ridge(gradient = TRUE))
# tinyplot(Species ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris, type = type_ridge(gradient = "viridis"))
# tinyplot(Species ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris, type = type_ridge(gradient = hcl.colors(512)))

## aside: when combining gradient fill with alpha transparency, it may be
## better to use the raster-based approach (test on your graphics device)
tinyplot(Species ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris,
  type = type_ridge(gradient = TRUE, alpha = 0.5),
  main = "polygon fill (default)")
tinyplot(Species ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris,
  type = type_ridge(gradient = TRUE, alpha = 0.5, raster = TRUE),
  main = "raster fill")

## highlighting only the center 50\% of the density (between 25\% and 75\% quantile)
tinyplot(Species ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris, col = "white",
  type = type_ridge(
    gradient = hcl.colors(3, "Dark Mint")[c(2, 1, 2)],
    probs = c(0.25, 0.75)))

## highlighting the probability distribution by color gradient (median = darkest point)
tinyplot(Species ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris,
  type = type_ridge(gradient = hcl.colors(250, "Dark Mint")[c(250:1, 1:250)],
  probs = 0:500/500))

## with faceting and color gradient
aq = transform(airquality, Late = ifelse(Day > 15, "Late", "Early"))
tinyplot(Month ~ Ozone, facet = ~ Late, data = aq,
  type = type_ridge(gradient = TRUE),
  grid = TRUE, axes = "t", col = "white")

## scaling of maximum density: jointly across all densities (default) vs. per facet
tinyplot(cyl ~ mpg, facet = ~ am, data = mtcars, type = "ridge", scale = 1)
tinyplot(cyl ~ mpg, facet = ~ am, data = mtcars, type = "ridge", scale = 1,
  joint.max = "facet")

## scaling of maximum density: jointly across all densities (default) vs. per by row
tinyplot(am ~ mpg | factor(cyl), data = mtcars, type = "ridge", scale = 1)
tinyplot(am ~ mpg | factor(cyl), data = mtcars, type = "ridge", scale = 1,
  joint.max = "by")
