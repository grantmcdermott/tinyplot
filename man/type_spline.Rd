\usage{
type_spline(
  n = NULL,
  method = "fmm",
  xmin = NULL,
  xmax = NULL,
  xout = NULL,
  ties = mean
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{if \code{xout} is left unspecified, interpolation takes place
       at \code{n} equally spaced points spanning the interval
       [\code{xmin}, \code{xmax}].}

\item{method}{specifies the type of spline to be used.  Possible
    values are \code{"fmm"}, \code{"natural"}, \code{"periodic"},
    \code{"monoH.FC"} and \code{"hyman"}.  Can be abbreviated.}

\item{xmin, xmax}{left-hand and right-hand endpoint of the
       interpolation interval (when \code{xout} is unspecified).}

\item{xout}{an optional set of values specifying where interpolation
    is to take place.}

\item{ties}{handling of tied \code{x} values.  The string
    \code{"ordered"} or a function (or the name of a function) taking a
    single vector argument and returning a single number or a length-2
    \code{\link{list}} of both, see \code{\link[stats]{approx}} and its
    \sQuote{Details} section, and the example below.}

\description{
Type function for plotting a cubic (or Hermite) spline interpolation.
Arguments are passed to \code{\link[stats]{spline}}; see this latter function
for default argument values.
}
\details{
The inputs can contain missing values which are deleted, so at least
  one complete \code{(x, y)} pair is required.
  If \code{method = "fmm"}, the spline used is that of
  Forsythe, Malcolm and Moler
  (an exact cubic is fitted through the four points at each
  end of the data, and this is used to determine the end conditions).
  Natural splines are used when \code{method = "natural"}, and periodic
  splines when \code{method = "periodic"}.

  The method \code{"monoH.FC"} computes a \emph{monotone} Hermite spline
  according to the method of Fritsch and Carlson.  It does so by
  determining slopes such that the Hermite spline, determined by
  \eqn{(x_i,y_i,m_i)}{(x[i],y[i],m[i])}, is monotone (increasing or
  decreasing) \bold{iff} the data are.

  Method \code{"hyman"} computes a \emph{monotone} cubic spline using
  Hyman filtering of an \code{method = "fmm"} fit for strictly monotonic
  inputs.

  These interpolation splines can also be used for extrapolation, that is
  prediction at points outside the range of \code{x}.  Extrapolation
  makes little sense for \code{method = "fmm"}; for natural splines it
  is linear using the slope of the interpolating curve at the nearest
  data point.

# "spline" type convenience string
tinyplot(dist ~ speed, data = cars, type = "spline")

# Use `type_spline()` to pass extra arguments for customization
tinyplot(dist ~ speed,
    data = cars, type = type_spline(method = "natural", n = 25),
    add = TRUE, lty = 2)
