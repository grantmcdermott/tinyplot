Each of these additional types are available either as a convenience string (with default behaviour) or a companion type_*() function (with options for customized behaviour).\nShapes:\n\n\"area\" / type_area(): Plots the area under the curve from y = 0 to y = f(x).\n\"errorbar\" / type_errorbar(): Adds error bars to points; requires ymin and ymax.\n\"pointrange\" / type_pointrange(): Combines points with error bars.\n\"polygon\" / type_polygon(): Draws polygons.\n\"polypath\" / type_polypath(): Draws a path whose vertices are given in x and y.\n\"rect\" / type_rect(): Draws rectangles; requires xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax.\n\"ribbon\" / type_ribbon(): Creates a filled area between ymin and ymax.\n\"segments\" / type_segments(): Draws line segments between pairs of points.\n\"text\" / type_text(): Add text annotations to a plot.\n\nVisualizations:\n\n\"boxplot\" / type_boxplot(): Creates a box-and-whisker plot.\n\"density\" / type_density(): Plots the density estimate of a variable.\n\"histogram\" / type_histogram(): Creates a histogram of a single variable.\n\"jitter\" / type_jitter(): Jittered points.\n\"qq\" / type_qq(): Creates a quantile-quantile plot.\n\"ridge\" / type_ridge(): Creates a ridgeline (aka joy) plot.\n\"rug\" / type_rug(): Adds a rug to an existing plot.\n\"spineplot\" / type_spineplot(): Creates a spineplot or spinogram.\n\nModels:\n\n\"loess\" / type_loess(): Local regression curve.\n\"lm\" / type_lm(): Linear regression line.\n\"glm\" / type_glm(): Generalized linear model fit.\n\"spline\" / type_spline(): Cubic (or Hermite) spline interpolation.\n\nFunctions:\n\ntype_abline(): line(s) with intercept and slope.\ntype_hline(): horizontal line(s).\ntype_vline(): vertical line(s).\ntype_function(): arbitrary function.\ntype_summary(): summarize y by unique values of x.\n\nTo see the difference between the convenience strings and their respective type_*() functional equivalents, let’s quickly walk through two examples.\nExample 1: jittering. We can add noise to data points using jittering. This allows us to avoid overplotting and can be useful to visualize discrete variables. On the left, we use the \"jitter string shortcut with default settings. On the right, we use the type_jitter() function to reduce the amount of jittering.\ntinyplot(\n  Temp ~ Month, data = aq, main = \"Default jittering\", \n  type = \"jitter\"\n)\ntinyplot(\n  Temp ~ Month, data = aq, main = \"Modest jittering\",\n  type = type_jitter(amount = 0.05)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2: Logit fit. In this example, we use type_glm() to fit a logistic regression model to the data, but with different confidence intervals.1\ntinyplot(\n  Hot ~ Wind, data = aq, main = \"Logit with 95% interval\",\n  type = type_glm(family = \"binomial\")\n)\ntinyplot(\n  Hot ~ Wind, data = aq, main = \"Logit with 50% interval\",\n  type = type_glm(family = \"binomial\", level = 0.5)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see what arguments are available for each type, simply consult the type-specific documentation.\n?type_jitter\n?type_glm\n# etc\nFinally, please note that all tinyplot types support grouping and faceting.\n\ntinyplot(Temp ~ Wind | Month, data = aq, facet = \"by\", type = \"lm\")",

    "text": "Custom types\nIt is easy to add custom types to tinyplot. Users who need highly customized plots, or developers who want to add support to their package or functions, only need to define three simple functions: data_typename(), draw_typename(), and type_typename().\nIn this section, we explain the role of each of these functions and present a minimalist example of a custom type. Interested readers may refer to the tinyplot source code to see many more examples, since each tinyplot type is itself implemented as a custom type.\nThe three functions that we need to define for a new type are:\n\ndata_*(): Function factory.\n\nAccepts a list of internal objects\n\nInputs must include ...\ndatapoints Is the most important object. It is a data frame with the datapoints to plot.\nOther objects that can be modified by data_*() include: by, facet, ylab, palette\n\nReturns a named list with modified versions of those objects.\n\ndraw_*(): Function factory.\n\nAccepts information about data point values and aesthetics.\n\nInputs must include ...\nThe i prefix in argument names indicates that we are operating on a subgroup of the data, identified by facet or using the | operator in a formula.\nAvailable arguments are: ibg, icol, ilty, ilwd, ipch, ix, ixmax, ixmin, iy, iymax, iymin, cex, dots, type, x_by, i, facet_by, by_data, facet_data, flip\n\nReturns a function which can call base R to draw the plot.\n\ntype_*(): A wrapper function that returns a named list with three elements:\n\ndraw\ndata\nname\n\n\nHere is a minimalist example of a custom type that logs both x and y and plots lines.\ntype_log = function(base = exp(1)) {\n\n  data_log = function() {\n    fun = function(datapoints, ...) {\n      datapoints$x = log(datapoints$x, base = base)\n      datapoints$y = log(datapoints$y, base = base)\n      datapoints = datapoints[order(datapoints$x), ]\n      return(list(datapoints = datapoints, ...))\n    }\n    return(fun)\n  }\n\n  draw_log = function() {\n    fun = function(ix, iy, icol, ...) {\n      points(\n        x = ix,\n        y = iy,\n        col = icol\n      )\n    }\n    return(fun)\n  }\n\n  out = list(\n    draw = draw_log(),\n    data = data_log(),\n    name = \"log\"\n  )\n  class(out) = \"tinyplot_type\"\n  return(out)\n}\n\ntinyplot(mpg ~ wt | factor(am), data = mtcars,\n  type = type_log(), main = \"Ln\")\ntinyplot(mpg ~ wt | factor(am), data = mtcars,\n  type = type_log(base = 10), main = \"Log 10\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo underscore what we said above, the tinyplot source code contains many examples of type constructor functions that should provide a helpful starting point for custom plot types. Failing that, the tinyplot team are always happy to help guide users on how to create their own types and re-purpose existing tinyplot code. Just let us know by raising an issue on our GitHub repo.",

In particular, tinyplot allows you to characterize groups using the by argument.1\n\n# tinyplot(aq$Day, aq$Temp, by = aq$Month) # same as below\nwith(aq, tinyplot(Day, Temp, by = Month))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn arguably more convenient approach is to use the equivalent formula syntax. Just place the “by” grouping variable after a vertical bar (i.e., |).\n\ntinyplot(Temp ~ Day | Month, data = aq)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use standard base plotting arguments to adjust features of your plot. For example, change pch (plot character) to get filled points and cex (character expansion) to change their size.\n\ntinyplot(\n  Temp ~ Day | Month, data = aq,\n  pch = 16,\n  cex = 2\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, converting to a grouped line plot is a simple matter of adjusting the type argument.\n\ntinyplot(\n  Temp ~ Day | Month, data = aq,\n  type = \"l\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default behaviour of tinyplot is to represent groups through colour. However, note that we can automatically adjust pch and lty by groups too by passing the \"by\" convenience keyword. This can be used in conjunction with the default group colouring. Or, as a replacement for group colouring—an option that may be particularly useful for contexts where colour is expensive or prohibited (e.g., certain academic journals).\n\ntinyplot(\n  Temp ~ Day | Month, data = aq,\n  type = \"l\",\n  col = \"black\", # override automatic group colours\n  lty = \"by\"     # change line type by group instead\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"by\" convenience argument is also available for mapping group colours to background fill bg (alias fill). One use case is to override the grouped border colours for filled plot characters and instead pass them through the background fill.\n\ntinyplot(\n  Temp ~ Day | Month, data = aq,\n  pch = 21,      # use filled circles\n  col = \"black\", # override automatic group (border) colours of points\n  fill = \"by\"    # use background fill by group instead\n)",

The default set of discrete colours are inherited from the user’s current global palette. (Most likely the “R4” set of colors; see ?palette). However, all of the various palettes listed by palette.pals() and hcl.pals() are supported as convenience strings.2 Note that case-insensitive, partial matching for these convenience string is allowed. For example:\n\ntinyplot(\n  Temp ~ Day | Month, data = aq,\n  type = \"l\",\n  palette = \"tableau\" # or \"ggplot\", \"okabe\", \"set2\", \"harmonic\", etc.\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond these convenience strings, users can also supply a valid palette-generating function for finer control and additional options.3 You can also use the alpha argument to adjust the (alpha) transparency of your colours:\n\ntinyplot(\n  Temp ~ Day | Month, data = aq,\n  pch = 19, cex = 2,\n  palette = \"tableau\",\n  alpha = 0.3\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo underscore what we said earlier, colours are inherited from the user’s current palette. So these can also be set globally, just as they can for the base plot function.

At a minimum, you can pass the familiar legend position keywords as a convenience string (“topright”, “bottom”, “left”, etc.). Moreover, a key feature of tinyplot is that we can easily and elegantly place the legend outside the plot area by adding a trailing “!” to these keywords. (As you may have realised, the default legend position is “right!”.) Let’s demonstrate by moving the legend to the left of the plot:\n\ntinyplot(\n  Temp ~ Day | Month, data = aq,\n  type = \"l\",\n  legend = \"left!\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond the convenience of these positional keywords, the legend argument also permits additional customization by passing an appropriate function (or, a list of arguments that will be passed on to the standard legend() function internally.) So you can change or turn off the legend title, remove the bounding box, switch the direction of the legend text to horizontal, etc. Here’s a grouped density plot example, where we also add some shading by specifying that the background colour should vary by groups too.\n\ntinyplot(\n  ~ Temp | Month,\n  data = aq,\n  type = \"density\",\n  fill = \"by\",                         # add fill by groups\n  grid = TRUE,                         # add background grid\n  legend = list(\"topright\", bty = \"o\") # change legend features\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of the legend examples that we have seen thus far are representations of discrete groups.

Note that here we pass a special convenience argument to bg/fill; if it detects a numeric in the range of [0,1], then it automatically inherits the grouped colour mappings but with added transparency.\n\ntinyplot(\n  Temp ~ Wind | Ozone, data = aq,\n  pch  = 21,      # use filled plot character\n  cex  = 2,\n  col  = \"black\", # override automatic (grouped) border colour of points\n  fill = 0.5,     # use background fill instead with added alpha transparency \n)",

In general, tinyplot supports all of the primitive plot types/elements available in base R, as well as a number of additional plot types that can be a bit tedious to code up manually. The full list of supported plot types can be viewed in this pinned GitHub issue, or by checking the ?tinyplot documentation.\nFor example, tinyplot supports interval plots via the \"pointrange\", \"errorbar\", \"ribbon\", and related type arguments. A canonical use-case is coefficient plots:\n\nmod = lm(Temp ~ 0 + Month / Day, data = aq)\n\n# grab coefs of interest\nmonthcoefs = data.frame(\n  gsub(\"Month\", \"\", names(coef(mod))),\n  coef(mod),\n  confint(mod)\n  ) |&gt;\n  setNames(c(\"term\", \"estimate\", \"ci_low\", \"ci_high\")) |&gt;\n  subset(!grepl(\"Day\", term))\n\n# plot\nwith(\n  monthcoefs,\n  tinyplot(\n    x = term, y = estimate,\n    ymin = ci_low, ymax = ci_high,\n    type = \"pointrange\", # or: \"errobar\", \"ribbon\"\n    pch = 19, col = \"dodgerblue\",\n    grid = TRUE,\n    main = \"Average Monthly Effect on Temperature\"\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntinyplot also supports special types to fit models and display their predictions, along with confidence intervals. Here is a somewhat silly example where we fit a linear model to predict temperature by day of month.4\n\ntinyplot(\n  Temp ~ Day | Month, aq,\n  type = \"lm\",\n  grid = TRUE,\n  main = \"Linear model\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default behaviour of these model types can be adjusted by passing appropriate arguments to the equivalent functional version of the type in question. These functional types all follow a type_&lt;typename&gt; syntax, so that \"lm\" is paired with type_lm(), etc. Below we illustrate an adapted generalised linear model, where we passing the binomial family argument and thus fit a logistic regression.\n\ntinyplot(\n  I(Temp &gt; 80) ~ Wind, aq,\n  type = type_glm(family = binomial),\n  main = \"Logit model: Temps above 80 °F\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will see examples of more plot types below, including other model prediction types.

Mirroring the main tinyplot function, the facet argument accepts both atomic and formula methods. In general, however, we recommend the formula version as being safer since it does a better job of handling missing values.\n\ntinyplot(\n  Temp ~ Day, aq,\n  facet = ~Month, ## &lt;= facet, not by\n  type = \"lm\",\n  grid = TRUE,\n  main = \"Predicted air temperatures\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacets are easily combined with grouping. This can either be done separately (i.e., distinct arguments for by and facet), or along the same dimension. For the latter case, we provide a special facet = \"by\" convenience shorthand.\n\ntinyplot(\n  Temp ~ Day | Month, aq,\n  facet = \"by\", # facet along same dimension as groups\n  type = \"lm\",\n  grid = TRUE,\n  main = \"Predicted air temperatures\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo customize facets, simply pass a list of named arguments through the companion facet.args argument. Customization options include: override the default “square” facet window arrangement; allow free-scaled axes so that the limits of each individual facet are drawn independently; adjust the padding (margin) between individual facets; change the facet title text and background; etc. Here is a simple example where we (1) arrange the facets in a single row, (2) add some background fill to the facet text, and (3) and reduce axis redundancy by turning off the plot frame.\n\ntinyplot(\n  Temp ~ Day, aq,\n  facet = ~Month, facet.args = list(nrow = 1, bg = \"grey90\"),\n  type = \"lm\",\n  grid = TRUE,\n  frame = FALSE, # turning off the plot frame means only outer axes will be printed\n  main = \"Predicted air temperatures\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe facet.args customizations can also be set globally via the tpar() function, or as part of a dedicated tinytheme(). We will revisit this idea in the Themes section below.\nFinally, the facet argument also accepts a two-sided formula for arranging facets in a fixed grid layout. Here’s a simple (if contrived) example.\n\ntinyplot(\n Temp ~ Day, data = aq,\n facet = windy ~ hot,\n # the rest of these arguments are optional...\n facet.args = list(col = \"white\", bg = \"black\"),\n pch = 16, col = \"dodgerblue\",\n grid = TRUE, frame = FALSE, ylim = c(50, 100),\n main = \"Daily temperatures vs. wind\"\n)",

    "section": "Layers",
    "text": "Layers\nIn many contexts, it is convenient to build plots step-by-step, adding layers with different elements on top of a base. The tinyplot package offers a few ways to achieve this layering effect.\nSimilar to many base plotting functions, users can invoke the tinyplot(..., add=TRUE) argument to draw a plot on top of an existing one, rather than opening a new window. However, while this argument is useful, it can become verbose since it requires users to make very similar successive calls, with many shared arguments.\nFor this reason, the tinyplot package provides a special tinyplot_add() convenience function for adding layers to an existing tinyplot. The idea is that users need simply pass the specific arguments that they want to add or modify relative to the base layer, and all arguments will be inherited from the original.\nAn example may help to demonstrate. Here we first draw some faceted points with group colouring and various other aesthetic tweaks. Next, we add regression fits with a simple tinyplot_add(type = \"lm\") call. Notice that the original grouping, data and aesthetic options are all carried over correctly, without having to repeat ourselves.\n\ntinyplot(\n  Temp ~ Day | Month, aq,\n  facet = \"by\", facet.args = list(bg = \"grey90\"),\n  palette = \"dark2\",\n  legend = FALSE,\n  grid = TRUE,\n  axes = \"l\",\n  ylim = c(50, 100),\n  main = \"Actual and predicted air temperatures\"\n)\n# Add regression fits\ntinyplot_add(type = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: plt_add() shorthand alias\n\n\n\nMuch like plt() is an alias for tinyplot(), you can save yourself a few keystrokes by typing plt_add() instead of tinyplot_add():\n\nplt_add(type = \"lm\")\n\n\n\nA related—but distinct—concept to adding plot layers is drawing on a plot. The canonical use case is annotating your plot with text or some other function-based (rather than data-based) logic. For example, you may want to demarcate some threshold values with horizontal or vertical lines, or simply annotate your plot with text. The tinyplot way to do this is by passing the tinyplot(..., draw = &lt;draw_function&gt;) argument. Here we demonstrate with a simplified version of our facet grid example from earlier.\n\ntinyplot(\n Temp ~ Day, data = aq,\n facet = windy ~ hot,\n # draw a horizontal (threshold) line in each facet using the abline function\n draw = abline(h = 75, lty = 2, col = \"hotpink\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to “manually” drawing these elements on a plot ex post—e.g., via a separate abline() call—there are several advantages to the idiomatic tinyplot interface. First, the draw argument is facet-aware and will ensure that each individual facet is correctly drawn upon. Second, you can leverage the special ii internal counter to draw programmatically across facets (see here). Third, the draw argument is fully generic and accepts any drawing/annotating function. You can combine multiple drawing functions by wrapping them with curly brackets{}, and even pass tinyplot() back towards itself.\nHere’s a slightly more complicated “spaghetti” plot example, where we pass multiple functions through draw = {...}, including drawing all of the lines in the background (of each facet) via a secondary tinyplot() call.\n\ntinyplot(\n  Temp ~ Day | Month, aq, facet = \"by\", lwd = 3, type = \"l\",\n  frame = FALSE, legend = FALSE, ylim = c(50, 100),\n  draw = {\n    tinyplot(Temp ~ Day | Month, aq, col = \"grey\", type = \"l\", add = TRUE)\n    abline(h = 75, lty = 2)\n    text(5.5, 75, \"Cold\", pos = 1, offset = 0.4)\n    text(5.5, 75, \"Hot\", pos = 3, offset = 0.4)\n  }\n)",

    "text": "Themes\nIn the examples thus far, we have adjusted our plot aesthetics manually by tweaking individual arguments and settings. A more convenient way to change the look of your plots is by calling the tinytheme() function. This will modify several graphical settings simultaneously to match a variety of pre-defined styles. In addition to convenience, themes have the added benefit of enabling dynamic adjustment of the plot regions, so that excess whitespace is reduced and long text strings (e.g., horizontal axis labels) are accounted for. Please see the ?tinytheme help page, as well as the dedicated Themes vignette for a detailed overview of tinyplot’s theming functionality. Here we provide a small taster by applying the “dark” theme to one of our earlier plots.\n\n# apply theme\ntinytheme(\"dark\")\n\n# plot\ntinyplot(\n  Temp ~ Wind | Ozone, data = aq,\n  main = \"An example of a tinytheme() in action\",\n  sub = \"Notice that the subtitle is above the plot\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# reset theme to default\ntinytheme()",

    "text": "Saving plots\nA final point to note is that tinyplot offers convenience features for exporting plots to disk. Simply invoke the file argument to specify the relevant file path (including the extension type). You can customize the output dimensions (in inches) via the accompanying width and height arguments.5\n\ntinyplot(\n  Temp ~ Day | Month, data = aq,\n  file = \"aq.png\", width = 8, height = 5\n)\n\n# optional: delete the saved plot\nunlink(\"aq.png\")\n\nAlongside convenience, the benefit of this native tinyplot approach (versus the traditional approach of manually opening an external graphics device, e.g. png()) is that all of your current graphic settings are automatically carried over to the exported file. Feel free to try yourself by setting some global graphics parameters via tpar() and then using file to save a plot.",

    "text": "Conclusion\nIn summary, consider the tinyplot package if you are looking for base R plot functionality with added convenience features. You can use (nearly) the exact same syntax and all of your theme elements should carry over too. It has no dependencies other than base R itself and this should make it an attractive option for package developers, as well as situations where dependency management is expensive (e.g., production pipelines, continuous integration or an R application running in a browser via WebAssembly).",

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nAt this point, experienced base plot users might protest that you can colour by groups using the col argument, e.g. with(aq, plot(Day, Temp, col = Month)). This is true, but there are several limitations. First, you don’t get an automatic legend. Second, the base plot.formula method doesn’t specify the grouping within the formula itself (not a deal-breaker, but not particularly consistent either). Third, and perhaps most importantly, this grouping doesn’t carry over to line plots (i.e., type=“l”). Instead, you have to transpose your data and use matplot. See this old StackOverflow thread for a longer discussion.↩︎\nSee the accompanying help pages of those two functions for more details on the available palettes, or read Zeileis & Murrell (2023, The R Journal, doi:10.32614/RJ-2023-071).↩︎\nFor example, if you have installed the ggsci package (link) then you could use palette = ggsci::pal_npg() to generate a palette consistent with those used by the Nature Publishing Group.↩︎\nThe grouped setting here makes this visualization equivalent to predict(lm(Temp ~ 0 + Month / Day, data = aq), interval = \"confidence\").↩︎\nThe default dimensions are 7x7, with a resolution of 300 DPI. However, these too can be customized via the file.width, file.height, and file.res parameters in tpar().↩︎",

    "text": "Extends par, serving as a (near) drop-in replacement for setting or querying graphical parameters. The key differences is that, beyond supporting the standard group of R graphical parameters in par, tpar also supports additional graphical parameters that are provided by tinyplot. Similar to par, parameters are set by passing appropriate key = value argument pairs, and multiple parameters can be set or queried at the same time.\n\n\n\ntpar(..., hook = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n\narguments of the form key = value. This includes all of the parameters typically supported by par, as well as the tinyplot-specific ones described in the ‘Graphical Parameters’ section below.\n\n\n\n\nhook\n\n\nLogical. If TRUE, base graphical parameters persist across plots via a hook applied before each new plot (see ?setHook).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tinyplot-specific parameters are saved in an internal environment called .tpar for performance and safety reasons. However, they can also be set at package load time via options, which may prove convenient for users that want to enable different default behaviour at startup (e.g., through an .Rprofile file). These options all take a tinyplot_* prefix, e.g. options(tinyplot_grid = TRUE, tinyplot_facet.bg = “grey90”).\nFor their part, any \"base\" graphical parameters are caught dynamically and passed on to par as appropriate. Technically, only parameters that satisfy par(…, no.readonly = TRUE) are evaluated.\nHowever, note the important distinction: tpar only evaluates parameters from par if they are passed explicitly by the user. This means that tpar should not be used to capture the (invisible) state of a user’s entire set of graphics parameters, i.e. tpar() != par(). If you want to capture the all existing graphics settings, then you should rather use par() instead.\n\n\n\nWhen parameters are set, their previous values are returned in an invisible named list. Such a list can be passed as an argument to tpar to restore the parameter values.\nWhen just one parameter is queried, the value of that parameter is returned as (atomic) vector. When two or more parameters are queried, their values are returned in a list, with the list names giving the parameters.\nNote the inconsistency: setting one parameter returns a list, but querying one parameter returns a vector.\n\n\n\n\n\nadj.xlab: Numeric value between 0 and 1 controlling the alignment of the x-axis label.\n\n\nadj.ylab: Numeric value between 0 and 1 controlling the alignment of the y-axis label.\n\n\ncairo: Logical indicating whether cairo_pdf should be used when writing plots to PDF. If FALSE, then pdf will be used instead, with implications for embedding (non-standard) fonts. Only used if tinyplot(…, file = “&lt;filename&gt;.pdf”) is called. Defaults to the value of capabilities(“cairo”).\n\n\ndynmar: Logical indicating whether tinyplot should attempt dynamic adjustment of margins to reduce whitespace and/or account for spacing of text elements (e.g., long horizontal y-axis labels). Note that this parameter is tightly coupled to internal tinythemes() logic and should not be adjusted manually unless you really know what you are doing or don’t mind risking unintended consequences to your plot.\n\n\nfacet.bg: Character or integer specifying the facet background colour. If an integer, will correspond to the user’s default colour palette (see palette). Passed to rect. Defaults to NULL (none).\n\n\nfacet.border: Character or integer specifying the facet border colour. If an integer, will correspond to the user’s default colour palette (see palette). Passed to rect. Defaults to NA (none).\n\n\nfacet.cex: Expansion factor for facet titles. Defaults to 1.\n\n\nfacet.col: Character or integer specifying the facet text colour. If an integer, will correspond to the user’s default global colour palette (see palette). Defaults to NULL, which is equivalent to \"black\".\n\n\nfacet.font: An integer corresponding to the desired font face for facet titles. For most font families and graphics devices, one of four possible values: 1 (regular), 2 (bold), 3 (italic), or 4 (bold italic). Defaults to NULL, which is equivalent to 1 (i.e., regular).\n\n\nfile.height: Numeric specifying the height (in inches) of any plot that is written to disk using the tinyplot(…, file = X) argument. Defaults to 7.\n\n\nfile.res: Numeric specifying the resolution (in dots per square inch) of any plot that is written to disk in bitmap format (i.e., PNG or JPEG) using the tinyplot(…, file = X) argument. Defaults to 300.\n\n\nfile.width: Numeric specifying the width (in inches) of any plot that is written to disk using the tinyplot(…, file = X) argument. Defaults to 7.\n\n\nfmar: A numeric vector of form c(b,l,t,r) for controlling the (base) margin padding, in terms of lines, between the individual facets in a faceted plot. Defaults to c(1,1,1,1). If more than three facets are detected, the fmar parameter is scaled by 0.75 to reduce excess whitespace. For 2x2 plots, the padding better matches the cex expansion logic of base graphics.\n\n\ngrid.col: Character or (integer) numeric that specifies the color of the panel grid lines. Defaults to “lightgray”.\n\n\ngrid.lty: Character or (integer) numeric that specifies the line type of the panel grid lines. Defaults to “dotted”.\n\n\ngrid.lwd: Non-negative numeric giving the line width of the panel grid lines. Defaults to 1.\n\n\ngrid: Logical indicating whether a background panel grid should be added to plots automatically. Defaults to NULL, which is equivalent to FALSE.\n\n\nlmar: A numeric vector of form c(inner, outer) that gives the margin padding, in terms of lines, around the automatic tinyplot legend. Defaults to c(1.0, 0.1). The inner margin is the gap between the legend and the plot region, and the outer margin is the gap between the legend and the edge of the graphics device.\n\n\npalette.qualitative: Palette for qualitative colors. See the palette argument in ?tinyplot.\n\n\npalette.sequential: Palette for sequential colors. See the palette argument in ?tinyplot.\n\n\nribbon.alpha: Numeric factor in the range [0,1] for modifying the opacity alpha of \"ribbon\" and \"area\" type plots. Default value is 0.2.\n\n\n\n\n\ngraphics::par which tpar builds on top of. get_saved_par is a convenience function for retrieving graphical parameters at different stages of a tinyplot call (and used for internal accounting purposes). tinytheme allows users to easily set a group of graphics parameters in a single function call, according to a variety of predefined themes.\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(\"tinyplot\")\n\n# Return a list of existing base and tinyplot graphic params\ntpar(\"las\", \"pch\", \"facet.bg\", \"facet.cex\", \"grid\")\n\n$las\n[1] 0\n\n$pch\n[1] 1\n\n$facet.bg\nNULL\n\n$facet.cex\n[1] 1\n\n$grid\n[1] FALSE\n\n# Simple facet plot with these default values\ntinyplot(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars, facet = ~am)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Set params to something new.

If a character specification is used, then it can either be of length 1 and specify the palette to be used with gradient = TRUE corresponding to gradient = “viridis”.

Should the gradient fill be drawn using rasterImage? Defaults to FALSE, in which case the gradient fill will instead be drawn using polygon. See the Technical note on gradient fills section below.\n\n\n\n\ncol\n\n\nCharacter string denoting the outline (border) color for all of the ridge densities. Note that a singular value is expected; if multiple colors are provided then only the first will be used. This argument is mostly useful for the aesthetic effect of drawing a common outline color in combination with gradient fills. See Examples.\n\n\n\n\nalpha\n\n\nNumeric in the range [0,1] for adjusting the alpha transparency of the density fills. In most cases, will default to a value of 1, i.e. fully opaque. But for some by grouped plots (excepting the special cases where by==y or by==x), will default to 0.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntinyplot uses two basic approaches for drawing gradient fills in ridge line plots, e.g., if type_ridge(gradient = TRUE).\nThe first (and default) polygon-based approach involves dividing up the main density region into many smaller polygons along the x-axis. Each of these smaller polygons inherits a different color \"segment\" from the underlying palette swatch, which in turn creates the effect of a continuous gradient when they are all plotted together. Internally, this polygon-based approach is vectorized (i.e., all of the sub-polygons are plotted simultaneously). It is thus efficient from a plotting perspective and generally also performs well from an aesthetic perspective. However, it can occasionally produce undesirable plotting artifacts on some graphics devices—e.g., thin but visible vertical lines—if alpha transparency is being used at the same time.\nFor this reason, we also offer an alternative raster-based approach for gradient fills that users can invoke via type_ridge(gradient = TRUE, raster = TRUE). The essential idea is that we coerce the density polygon into a raster representation (using rasterImage) and achieve the gradient effect via color interpolation. The trade-off this time is potential smoothness artifacts around the top of the ridge densities at high resolutions, since we have converted a vector object into a raster object.\nAgain, we expect that the choice between these two approaches will only matter for ridge plots that combine gradient fills with alpha transparency (and on certain graphics devices). We recommend that users experiment to determine which approach is optimal for their device.\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(\"tinyplot\")\n\naq = transform(\n  airquality,\n  Month = factor(month.abb[Month], levels = month.abb[5:9]),\n  Month2 = factor(month.name[Month], levels = month.name[5:9]),\n  Late = ifelse(Day &gt; 15, \"Late\", \"Early\")\n  )\n\n# default ridge plot (using the \"ridge\" convenience string)\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp, data = aq, type = \"ridge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# for ridge plots, we recommend pairing with the dedicated theme(s), which\n# facilitate nicer y-axis labels, grid lines, etc.\n\ntinytheme(\"ridge\")\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp, data = aq, type = \"ridge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntinytheme(\"ridge2\") # removes the plot frame (but keeps x-axis line)\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp, data = aq, type = \"ridge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# the \"ridge(2)\" themes are especially helpful for long y labels, due to\n# dyanmic plot adjustment\ntinyplot(Month2 ~ Temp, data = aq, type = \"ridge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# pass customization arguments through type_ridge()... for example, use\n# the scale argument to change/avoid overlap of densities (more on scaling\n# further below)\n\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp, data = aq, type = type_ridge(scale = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## by grouping is also supported. two special cases of interest:\n\n# 1) by == y (color by y groups)\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp | Month, data = aq, type = \"ridge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 2) by == x (gradient coloring along x)\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp | Temp, data = aq, type = \"ridge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# aside: pass explicit `type_ridge(col = &lt;col&gt;)` arg to set a different\n# border color\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp | Temp, data = aq, type = type_ridge(col = \"white\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# gradient coloring along the x-axis can also be invoked manually without\n# a legend (the next two tinyplot calls are equivalent)\n\n# tinyplot(Month ~ Temp, data = aq, type = type_ridge(gradient = \"agsunset\"))\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp, data = aq, type = type_ridge(gradient = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# aside: when combining gradient fill with alpha transparency, it may be\n# better to use the raster-based approach (test on your graphics device)\n\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp, data = aq,\n  type = type_ridge(gradient = TRUE, alpha = 0.5),\n  main = \"polygon fill (default)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp, data = aq,\n  type = type_ridge(gradient = TRUE, alpha = 0.5, raster = TRUE),\n  main = \"raster fill\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# highlighting only the center 50% of the density (i.e., 25%-75% quantiles)\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp, data = aq, type = type_ridge(\n  gradient = hcl.colors(3, \"Dark Mint\")[c(2, 1, 2)],\n  probs = c(0.25, 0.75), col = \"white\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# highlighting the probability distribution by color gradient\n# (darkest point = median)\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp, data = aq, type = type_ridge(\n  gradient = hcl.colors(250, \"Dark Mint\")[c(250:1, 1:250)],\n  probs = 0:500/500))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# faceting also works, although we recommend switching (back) to the \"ridge\"\n# theme for faceted ridge plots\n\ntinytheme(\"ridge\")\ntinyplot(Month ~ Ozone, facet = ~ Late, data = aq,\n  type = type_ridge(gradient = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## use the joint.max argument to vary the maximum density used for\n## determining relative scaling...\n\n# jointly across all densities (default) vs. per facet\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp, facet = ~ Late, data = aq,\n  type = type_ridge(scale = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp, facet = ~ Late, data = aq,\n  type = type_ridge(scale = 1, joint.max = \"facet\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# jointly across all densities (default) vs. per by row\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp | Late, data = aq,\n  type = type_ridge(scale = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp | Late, data = aq,\n  type = type_ridge(scale = 1, joint.max = \"by\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# restore the default theme\ntinytheme()",

Alternatively, “facet” indicates that the maximum is computed within each facet so that the areas of the densities are comparable within each facet but not necessarily across facets. Finally, “by” indicates that each row (in each facet) is scaled separately, so that the areas of the densities for by groups in the same row are comparable but not necessarily across rows.\n\n\n\n\nbreaks\n\n\nNumeric. If a color gradient is used for shading, the breaks between the colors can be modified. The default is to use equidistant breaks spanning the range of the x variable.\n\n\n\n\nprobs\n\n\nNumeric. Instead of specifying the same breaks on the x-axis for all groups, it is possible to specify group-specific quantiles at the specified probs. The quantiles are computed based on the density (rather than the raw original variable). Only one of breaks or probs must be specified.\n\n\n\n\nylevels\n\n\na character or numeric vector specifying in which order the levels of the y-variable should be plotted.\n\n\n\n\nbw\n\n\nthe smoothing bandwidth to be used. The kernels are scaled such that this is the standard deviation of the smoothing kernel. (Note this differs from the reference books cited below.)\nbw can also be a character string giving a rule to choose the bandwidth. See bw.nrd.  The default, “nrd0”, has remained the default for historical and compatibility reasons, rather than as a general recommendation, where e.g., “SJ” would rather fit, see also Venables and Ripley (2002).\nThe specified (or computed) value of bw is multiplied by adjust.\n\n\n\n\njoint.bw\n\n\ncharacter string indicating whether (and how) the smoothing bandwidth should be computed from the joint data distribution. The default of “mean” will compute the joint bandwidth as the mean of the individual subgroup bandwidths (weighted by their number of observations). Choosing “full” will result in a joint bandwidth computed from the full distribution (merging all subgroups). For “none” the individual bandwidth will be computed independently for each subgroup. Also accepts a logical argument, where TRUE maps to “mean” and FALSE maps to “none”. See type_density for some discussion of practical considerations.\n\n\n\n\nadjust\n\n\nthe bandwidth used is actually adjust*bw. This makes it easy to specify values like ‘half the default’ bandwidth.\n\n\n\n\nkernel\n\n\na character string giving the smoothing kernel to be used. This must partially match one of “gaussian”, “rectangular”, “triangular”, “epanechnikov”, “biweight”, “cosine” or “optcosine”, with default “gaussian”, and may be abbreviated to a unique prefix (single letter).\n“cosine” is smoother than “optcosine”, which is the usual ‘cosine’ kernel in the literature and almost MSE-efficient. However, “cosine” is the version used by S.\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\nthe number of equally spaced points at which the density is to be estimated. When n &gt; 512, it is rounded up to a power of 2 during the calculations (as fft is used) and the final result is interpolated by approx. So it almost always makes sense to specify n as a power of two.\n\n\n\n\ngradient\n\n\nLogical or character. Should a gradient fill be used to shade the area under the density? If a character specification is used, then it can either be of length 1 and specify the palette to be used with gradient = TRUE corresponding to gradient = “viridis”. If a character vector of length greater than 1 is used, then it should specify the colors in the palette, e.g., gradient = hcl.colors(512).\n\n\n\n\nraster\n\n\nLogical. Should the gradient fill be drawn using rasterImage? Defaults to FALSE, in which case the gradient fill will instead be drawn using polygon. See the Technical note on gradient fills section below.\n\n\n\n\ncol\n\n\nCharacter string denoting the outline (border) color for all of the ridge densities. Note that a singular value is expected; if multiple colors are provided then only the first will be used. This argument is mostly useful for the aesthetic effect of drawing a common outline color in combination with gradient fills. See Examples.\n\n\n\n\nalpha\n\n\nNumeric in the range [0,1] for adjusting the alpha transparency of the density fills. In most cases, will default to a value of 1, i.e. fully opaque. But for some by grouped plots (excepting the special cases where by==y or by==x), will default to 0.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntinyplot uses two basic approaches for drawing gradient fills in ridge line plots, e.g., if type_ridge(gradient = TRUE).\nThe first (and default) polygon-based approach involves dividing up the main density region into many smaller polygons along the x-axis. Each of these smaller polygons inherits a different color \"segment\" from the underlying palette swatch, which in turn creates the effect of a continuous gradient when they are all plotted together. Internally, this polygon-based approach is vectorized (i.e., all of the sub-polygons are plotted simultaneously). It is thus efficient from a plotting perspective and generally also performs well from an aesthetic perspective. However, it can occasionally produce undesirable plotting artifacts on some graphics devices—e.g., thin but visible vertical lines—if alpha transparency is being used at the same time.\nFor this reason, we also offer an alternative raster-based approach for gradient fills that users can invoke via type_ridge(gradient = TRUE, raster = TRUE). The essential idea is that we coerce the density polygon into a raster representation (using rasterImage) and achieve the gradient effect via color interpolation. The trade-off this time is potential smoothness artifacts around the top of the ridge densities at high resolutions, since we have converted a vector object into a raster object.\nAgain, we expect that the choice between these two approaches will only matter for ridge plots that combine gradient fills with alpha transparency (and on certain graphics devices). We recommend that users experiment to determine which approach is optimal for their device.\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(\"tinyplot\")\n\naq = transform(\n  airquality,\n  Month = factor(month.abb[Month], levels = month.abb[5:9]),\n  Month2 = factor(month.name[Month], levels = month.name[5:9]),\n  Late = ifelse(Day &gt; 15, \"Late\", \"Early\")\n  )\n\n# default ridge plot (using the \"ridge\" convenience string)\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp, data = aq, type = \"ridge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# for ridge plots, we recommend pairing with the dedicated theme(s), which\n# facilitate nicer y-axis labels, grid lines, etc.\n\ntinytheme(\"ridge\")\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp, data = aq, type = \"ridge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntinytheme(\"ridge2\") # removes the plot frame (but keeps x-axis line)\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp, data = aq, type = \"ridge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# the \"ridge(2)\" themes are especially helpful for long y labels, due to\n# dyanmic plot adjustment\ntinyplot(Month2 ~ Temp, data = aq, type = \"ridge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# pass customization arguments through type_ridge()... for example, use\n# the scale argument to change/avoid overlap of densities (more on scaling\n# further below)\n\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp, data = aq, type = type_ridge(scale = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## by grouping is also supported. two special cases of interest:\n\n# 1) by == y (color by y groups)\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp | Month, data = aq, type = \"ridge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 2) by == x (gradient coloring along x)\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp | Temp, data = aq, type = \"ridge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# aside: pass explicit `type_ridge(col = &lt;col&gt;)` arg to set a different\n# border color\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp | Temp, data = aq, type = type_ridge(col = \"white\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# gradient coloring along the x-axis can also be invoked manually without\n# a legend (the next two tinyplot calls are equivalent)\n\n# tinyplot(Month ~ Temp, data = aq, type = type_ridge(gradient = \"agsunset\"))\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp, data = aq, type = type_ridge(gradient = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# aside: when combining gradient fill with alpha transparency, it may be\n# better to use the raster-based approach (test on your graphics device)\n\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp, data = aq,\n  type = type_ridge(gradient = TRUE, alpha = 0.5),\n  main = \"polygon fill (default)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp, data = aq,\n  type = type_ridge(gradient = TRUE, alpha = 0.5, raster = TRUE),\n  main = \"raster fill\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# highlighting only the center 50% of the density (i.e., 25%-75% quantiles)\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp, data = aq, type = type_ridge(\n  gradient = hcl.colors(3, \"Dark Mint\")[c(2, 1, 2)],\n  probs = c(0.25, 0.75), col = \"white\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# highlighting the probability distribution by color gradient\n# (darkest point = median)\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp, data = aq, type = type_ridge(\n  gradient = hcl.colors(250, \"Dark Mint\")[c(250:1, 1:250)],\n  probs = 0:500/500))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# faceting also works, although we recommend switching (back) to the \"ridge\"\n# theme for faceted ridge plots\n\ntinytheme(\"ridge\")\ntinyplot(Month ~ Ozone, facet = ~ Late, data = aq,\n  type = type_ridge(gradient = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## use the joint.max argument to vary the maximum density used for\n## determining relative scaling...\n\n# jointly across all densities (default) vs. per facet\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp, facet = ~ Late, data = aq,\n  type = type_ridge(scale = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp, facet = ~ Late, data = aq,\n  type = type_ridge(scale = 1, joint.max = \"facet\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# jointly across all densities (default) vs. per by row\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp | Late, data = aq,\n  type = type_ridge(scale = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntinyplot(Month ~ Temp | Late, data = aq,\n  type = type_ridge(scale = 1, joint.max = \"by\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# restore the default theme\ntinytheme()",

Any reasonable way of defining the coordinates is acceptable; most likely the names of existing vectors or columns of data frames.

If type is a character specification (such as “hist”) then any argument names that match those from the corresponding type_*() function (such as type_hist) are passed on to that. All remaining arguments from … can be further graphical parameters, see par).\n\n\n\n\nby\n\n\ngrouping variable(s). The default behaviour is for groups to be represented in the form of distinct colours, which will also trigger an automatic legend. (See legend below for customization options.) However, groups can also be presented through other plot parameters (e.g., pch or lty) by passing an appropriate \"by\" keyword; see Examples. Note that continuous (i.e., gradient) colour legends are also supported if the user passes a numeric or integer to by. To group by multiple variables, wrap them with interaction.\n\n\n\n\nfacet\n\n\nthe faceting variable(s) that you want arrange separate plot windows by. Can be specified in various ways:\n\n\nIn \"atomic\" form, e.g. facet = fvar. To facet by multiple variables in atomic form, simply interact them, e.g. interaction(fvar1, fvar2) or factor(fvar1):factor(fvar2).\n\n\nAs a one-sided formula, e.g. facet = ~fvar. Multiple variables can be specified in the formula RHS, e.g. ~fvar1 + fvar2 or ~fvar1:fvar2. Note that these multi-variable cases are all treated equivalently and converted to interaction(fvar1, fvar2, …) internally. (No distinction is made between different types of binary operators, for example, and so f1+f2 is treated the same as f1:f2, is treated the same as f1*f2, etc.)\n\n\nAs a two-side formula, e.g. facet = fvar1 ~ fvar2. In this case, the facet windows are arranged in a fixed grid layout, with the formula LHS defining the facet rows and the RHS defining the facet columns. At present only single variables on each side of the formula are well supported. (We don’t recommend trying to use multiple variables on either the LHS or RHS of the two-sided formula case.)\n\n\nAs a special “by” convenience keyword, in which case facets will match the grouping variable(s) passed to by above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfacet.args\n\n\nan optional list of arguments for controlling faceting behaviour. (Ignored if facet is NULL.) Supported arguments are as follows:\n\n\nnrow, ncol for overriding the default \"square\" facet window arrangement. Only one of these should be specified, but nrow will take precedence if both are specified together. Ignored if a two-sided formula is passed to the main facet argument, since the layout is arranged in a fixed grid.\n\n\nfree a logical value indicating whether the axis limits (scales) for each individual facet should adjust independently to match the range of the data within that facet. Default is FALSE. Separate free scaling of the x- or y-axis (i.e., whilst holding the other axis fixed) is not currently supported.\n\n\nfmar a vector of form c(b,l,t,r) for controlling the base margin between facets in terms of lines. Defaults to the value of tpar(“fmar”), which should be c(1,1,1,1), i.e. a single line of padding around each individual facet, assuming it hasn’t been overridden by the user as part their global tpar settings. Note some automatic adjustments are made for certain layouts, and depending on whether the plot is framed or not, to reduce excess whitespace. See tpar for more details.\n\n\ncex, font, col, bg, border for adjusting the facet title text and background. Default values for these arguments are inherited from tpar (where they take a \"facet.\" prefix, e.g. tpar(“facet.cex”)). The latter function can also be used to set these features globally for all tinyplot plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata\n\n\na data.frame (or list) from which the variables in formula should be taken. A matrix is converted to a data frame.\n\n\n\n\ntype\n\n\ncharacter string or call to a type_*() function giving the type of plot desired.\n\n\nNULL (default): Choose a sensible type for the type of x and y inputs (i.e., usually “p”).\n\n\n1-character values supported by plot:\n\n\n“p” Points\n\n\n“l” Lines\n\n\n“b” Both points and lines\n\n\n“c” Empty points joined by lines\n\n\n“o” Overplotted points and lines\n\n\n“s” Stair steps\n\n\n“S” Stair steps\n\n\n“h” Histogram-like vertical lines\n\n\n“n” Empty plot over the extent of the data\n\n\n\n\ntinyplot-specific types. These fall into several categories:\n\n\nShapes:\n\n\n“area” / type_area(): Plots the area under the curve from y = 0 to y = f(x).\n\n\n“errorbar” / type_errorbar(): Adds error bars to points; requires ymin and ymax.\n\n\n“pointrange” / type_pointrange(): Combines points with error bars.\n\n\n“polygon” / type_polygon(): Draws polygons.\n\n\n“polypath” / type_polypath(): Draws a path whose vertices are given in x and y.\n\n\n“rect” / type_rect(): Draws rectangles; requires xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax.\n\n\n“ribbon” / type_ribbon(): Creates a filled area between ymin and ymax.\n\n\n“segments” / type_segments(): Draws line segments between pairs of points.\n\n\n“text” / type_text(): Add text annotations.\n\n\n\n\nVisualizations:\n\n\n“boxplot” / type_boxplot(): Creates a box-and-whisker plot.\n\n\n“density” / type_density(): Plots the density estimate of a variable.\n\n\n“histogram” / type_histogram(): Creates a histogram of a single variable.\n\n\n“jitter” / type_jitter(): Jittered points.\n\n\n“qq” / type_qq(): Creates a quantile-quantile plot.\n\n\n“ridge” / type_ridge(): Creates a ridgeline (aka joy) plot.\n\n\n“rug” / type_rug(): Adds a rug to an existing plot.\n\n\n“spineplot” / type_spineplot(): Creates a spineplot or spinogram.\n\n\n\n\nModels:\n\n\n“loess” / type_loess(): Local regression curve.\n\n\n“lm” / type_lm(): Linear regression line.\n\n\n“glm” / type_glm(): Generalized linear model fit.\n\n\n“spline” / type_spline(): Cubic (or Hermite) spline interpolation.\n\n\n\n\nFunctions:\n\n\ntype_abline(): line(s) with intercept and slope.\n\n\ntype_hline(): horizontal line(s).\n\n\ntype_vline(): vertical line(s).\n\n\ntype_function(): arbitrary function.\n\n\ntype_summary(): summarize y by unique values of x.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nxlim\n\n\nthe x limits (x1, x2) of the plot. Note that x1 &gt; x2 is allowed and leads to a ‘reversed axis’. The default value, NULL, indicates that the range of the finite values to be plotted should be used.\n\n\n\n\nylim\n\n\nthe y limits of the plot.\n\n\n\n\nlog\n\n\na character string which contains \"x\" if the x axis is to be logarithmic, \"y\" if the y axis is to be logarithmic and \"xy\" or \"yx\" if both axes are to be logarithmic.\n\n\n\n\nmain\n\n\na main title for the plot, see also title.\n\n\n\n\nsub\n\n\na subtitle for the plot.\n\n\n\n\nxlab\n\n\na label for the x axis, defaults to a description of x.\n\n\n\n\nylab\n\n\na label for the y axis, defaults to a description of y.\n\n\n\n\nann\n\n\na logical value indicating whether the default annotation (title and x and y axis labels) should appear on the plot.\n\n\n\n\naxes\n\n\nlogical or character. Should axes be drawn (TRUE or FALSE)? Or alternatively what type of axes should be drawn: “standard” (with axis, ticks, and labels; equivalent to TRUE), “none” (no axes; equivalent to FALSE), “ticks” (only ticks and labels without axis line), “labels” (only labels without ticks and axis line), “axis” (only axis line and labels but no ticks). To control this separately for the two axes, use the character specifications for xaxt and/or yaxt.\n\n\n\n\nframe.plot\n\n\na logical indicating whether a box should be drawn around the plot. Can also use frame as an acceptable argument alias. The default is to draw a frame if both axis types (set via axes, xaxt, or yaxt) include axis lines.\n\n\n\n\nasp\n\n\nthe y/xy/x aspect ratio, see plot.window.\n\n\n\n\ngrid\n\n\nargument for plotting a background panel grid, one of either:\n\n\na logical (i.e., TRUE to draw the grid), or\n\n\na panel grid plotting function like grid(). Note that this argument replaces the panel.first and panel.last arguments from base plot() and tries to make the process more seamless with better default behaviour. The default behaviour is determined by (and can be set globally through) the value of tpar(“grid”).\n\n\n\n\n\n\npalette\n\n\none of the following options:\n\n\nNULL (default), in which case the palette will be chosen according to the class and cardinality of the \"by\" grouping variable. For non-ordered factors or strings with a reasonable number of groups, this will inherit directly from the user’s default palette (e.g., \"R4\"). In other cases, including ordered factors and high cardinality, the \"Viridis\" palette will be used instead. Note that a slightly restricted version of the \"Viridis\" palette—where extreme color values have been trimmed to improve visual perception—will be used for ordered factors and continuous variables. In the latter case of a continuous grouping variable, we also generate a gradient legend swatch.\n\n\nA convenience string corresponding to one of the many palettes listed by either palette.pals() or hcl.pals(). Note that the string can be case-insensitive (e.g., \"Okabe-Ito\" and \"okabe-ito\" are both valid).\n\n\nA palette-generating function. This can be \"bare\" (e.g., palette.colors) or \"closed\" with a set of named arguments (e.g., palette.colors(palette = “Okabe-Ito”, alpha = 0.5)). Note that any unnamed arguments will be ignored and the key n argument, denoting the number of colours, will automatically be spliced in as the number of groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlegend\n\n\none of the following options:\n\n\nNULL (default), in which case the legend will be determined by the grouping variable. If there is no group variable (i.e., by is NULL) then no legend is drawn. If a grouping variable is detected, then an automatic legend is drawn to the outer right of the plotting area. Note that the legend title and categories will automatically be inferred from the by argument and underlying data.\n\n\nA convenience string indicating the legend position. The string should correspond to one of the position keywords supported by the base legend function, e.g. \"right\", \"topleft\", \"bottom\", etc. In addition, tinyplot supports adding a trailing exclamation point to these keywords, e.g. \"right!\", \"topleft!\", or \"bottom!\". This will place the legend outside the plotting area and adjust the margins of the plot accordingly. Finally, users can also turn off any legend printing by specifying \"none\".\n\n\nLogical value, where TRUE corresponds to the default case above (same effect as specifying NULL) and FALSE turns the legend off (same effect as specifying \"none\").\n\n\nA list or, equivalently, a dedicated legend() function with supported legend arguments, e.g. \"bty\", \"horiz\", and so forth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npch\n\n\nplotting \"character\", i.e., symbol to use. Character, integer, or vector of length equal to the number of categories in the by variable. See pch. In addition, users can supply a special pch = “by” convenience argument, in which case the characters will automatically loop over the number groups. This automatic looping will begin at the global character value (i.e., par(“pch”)) and recycle as necessary.\n\n\n\n\nlty\n\n\nline type. Character, integer, or vector of length equal to the number of categories in the by variable. See lty. In addition, users can supply a special lty = “by” convenience argument, in which case the line type will automatically loop over the number groups. This automatic looping will begin at the global line type value (i.e., par(“lty”)) and recycle as necessary.\n\n\n\n\nlwd\n\n\nline width. Numeric scalar or vector of length equal to the number of categories in the by variable. See lwd. In addition, users can supply a special lwd = “by” convenience argument, in which case the line width will automatically loop over the number of groups. This automatic looping will be centered at the global line width value (i.e.,\n\n\n\n\ncol\n\n\nplotting color. Character, integer, or vector of length equal to the number of categories in the by variable. See col. Note that the default behaviour in tinyplot is to vary group colors along any variables declared in the by argument. Thus, specifying colors manually should not be necessary unless users wish to override the automatic colors produced by this grouping process. Typically, this would only be done if grouping features are deferred to some other graphical parameter (i.e., passing the \"by\" keyword to one of pch, lty, lwd, or bg; see below.)\n\n\n\n\nbg\n\n\nbackground fill color for the open plot symbols 21:25 (see points.default), as well as ribbon and area plot types. Users can also supply either one of two special convenience arguments that will cause the background fill to inherit the automatic grouped coloring behaviour of col:\n\n\nbg = “by” will insert a background fill that inherits the main color mappings from col.\n\n\nby = &lt;numeric[0,1]&gt; (i.e., a numeric in the range [0,1]) will insert a background fill that inherits the main color mapping(s) from col, but with added alpha-transparency.\n\n\nFor both of these convenience arguments, note that the (grouped) bg mappings will persist even if the (grouped) col defaults are themselves overridden. This can be useful if you want to preserve the grouped palette mappings by background fill but not boundary color, e.g. filled points. See examples.\n\n\n\n\nfill\n\n\nalias for bg. If non-NULL values for both bg and fill are provided, then the latter will be ignored in favour of the former.\n\n\n\n\nalpha\n\n\na numeric in the range [0,1] for adjusting the alpha channel of the color palette, where 0 means transparent and 1 means opaque. Use fractional values, e.g. 0.5 for semi-transparency.\n\n\n\n\ncex\n\n\ncharacter expansion. A numerical vector (can be a single value) giving the amount by which plotting characters and symbols should be scaled relative to the default. Note that NULL is equivalent to 1.0, while NA renders the characters invisible.\n\n\n\n\nrestore.par\n\n\na logical value indicating whether the par settings prior to calling tinyplot should be restored on exit. Defaults to FALSE, which makes it possible to add elements to the plot after it has been drawn. However, note the the outer margins of the graphics device may have been altered to make space for the tinyplot legend. Users can opt out of this persistent behaviour by setting to TRUE instead. See also get_saved_par for another option to recover the original par settings, as well as longer discussion about the trade-offs involved.\n\n\n\n\nxmin, xmax, ymin, ymax\n\n\nminimum and maximum coordinates of relevant area or interval plot types. Only used when the type argument is one of “rect” or “segments” (where all four min-max coordinates are required), or “pointrange”, “errorbar”, or “ribbon” (where only ymin and ymax required alongside x).\n\n\n\n\nadd\n\n\nlogical. If TRUE, then elements are added to the current plot rather than drawing a new plot window. Note that the automatic legend for the added elements will be turned off. See also tinyplot_add, which provides a convenient wrapper around this functionality for layering on top of an existing plot without having to repeat arguments.\n\n\n\n\ndraw\n\n\na function that draws directly on the plot canvas (before x and y are plotted). The draw argument is primarily useful for adding common elements to each facet of a faceted plot, e.g. abline or text. Note that this argument is somewhat experimental and that no internal checking is done for correctness; the provided argument is simply captured and evaluated as-is. See Examples.\n\n\n\n\nfile\n\n\ncharacter string giving the file path for writing a plot to disk. If specified, the plot will not be displayed interactively, but rather sent to the appropriate external graphics device (i.e., png, jpeg, pdf, or svg). As a point of convenience, note that any global parameters held in (t)par are automatically carried over to the external device and don’t need to be reset (in contrast to the conventional base R approach that requires manually opening and closing the device). The device type is determined by the file extension at the end of the provided path, and must be one of \".png\", \".jpg\" (\".jpeg\"), \".pdf\", or \".svg\". (Other file types may be supported in the future.) The file dimensions can be controlled by the corresponding width and height arguments below, otherwise will fall back to the “file.width” and “file.height” values held in tpar (i.e., both defaulting to 7 inches, and where the default resolution for bitmap files is also specified as 300 DPI).\n\n\n\n\nwidth\n\n\nnumeric giving the plot width in inches. Together with height, typically used in conjunction with the file argument above, overriding the default values held in tpar(“file.width”, “file.height”). If either width or height is specified, but a corresponding file argument is not provided as well, then a new interactive graphics device dimensions will be opened along the given dimensions. Note that this interactive resizing may not work consistently from within an IDE like RStudio that has an integrated graphics windows.\n\n\n\n\nheight\n\n\nnumeric giving the plot height in inches. Same considerations as width (above) apply, e.g. will default to tpar(“file.height”) if not specified.\n\n\n\n\nempty\n\n\nlogical indicating whether the interior plot region should be left empty. The default is FALSE. Setting to TRUE has a similar effect to invoking type = “n” above, except that any legend artifacts owing to a particular plot type (e.g., lines for type = “l” or squares for type = “area”) will still be drawn correctly alongside the empty plot. In contrast,type = “n” implicitly assumes a scatterplot and so any legend will only depict points.\n\n\n\n\nxaxt, yaxt\n\n\ncharacter specifying the type of x-axis and y-axis, respectively. See axes for the possible values.\n\n\n\n\nflip\n\n\nlogical. Should the plot orientation be flipped, so that the y-axis is on the horizontal plane and the x-axis is on the vertical plane? Default is FALSE.\n\n\n\n\nxaxs, yaxs\n\n\ncharacter specifying the style of the interval calculation used for the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. See par for the possible values.\n\n\n\n\nformula\n\n\na formula that optionally includes grouping variable(s) after a vertical bar, e.g. y ~ x | z. One-sided formulae are also permitted, e.g. ~ y | z. Multiple grouping variables can be specified in different ways, e.g. y ~ x | z1:z2 or y ~ x | z1 + z2. (These two representations are treated as equivalent; both are parsed as interaction(z1, z2) internally.) Note that the formula and x arguments should not be specified in the same call.\n\n\n\n\nsubset, na.action, drop.unused.levels\n\n\narguments passed to model.frame when extracting the data from formula and data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisregarding the enhancements that it supports, tinyplot tries as far as possible to mimic the behaviour and syntax logic of the original base plot function. Users should therefore be able to swap out existing plot calls for tinyplot (or its shorthand alias plt), without causing unexpected changes to the output.\n\n\n\nNo return value, called for side effect of producing a plot.\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(\"tinyplot\")\n\n#'\naq = transform(\n  airquality,\n  Month = factor(Month, labels = month.abb[unique(Month)])\n)\n\n# In most cases, `tinyplot` should be a drop-in replacement for regular\n# `plot` calls.

Any reasonable way of defining the coordinates is acceptable; most likely the names of existing vectors or columns of data frames. See the ‘Examples’ section below, or the function xy.coords for details. If supplied separately, x and y must be of the same length.\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n\nother graphical parameters. If type is a character specification (such as “hist”) then any argument names that match those from the corresponding type_*() function (such as type_hist) are passed on to that. All remaining arguments from … can be further graphical parameters, see par).\n\n\n\n\nby\n\n\ngrouping variable(s). The default behaviour is for groups to be represented in the form of distinct colours, which will also trigger an automatic legend. (See legend below for customization options.) However, groups can also be presented through other plot parameters (e.g., pch or lty) by passing an appropriate \"by\" keyword; see Examples. Note that continuous (i.e., gradient) colour legends are also supported if the user passes a numeric or integer to by. To group by multiple variables, wrap them with interaction.\n\n\n\n\nfacet\n\n\nthe faceting variable(s) that you want arrange separate plot windows by. Can be specified in various ways:\n\n\nIn \"atomic\" form, e.g. facet = fvar. To facet by multiple variables in atomic form, simply interact them, e.g. interaction(fvar1, fvar2) or factor(fvar1):factor(fvar2).\n\n\nAs a one-sided formula, e.g. facet = ~fvar. Multiple variables can be specified in the formula RHS, e.g. ~fvar1 + fvar2 or ~fvar1:fvar2. Note that these multi-variable cases are all treated equivalently and converted to interaction(fvar1, fvar2, …) internally. (No distinction is made between different types of binary operators, for example, and so f1+f2 is treated the same as f1:f2, is treated the same as f1*f2, etc.)\n\n\nAs a two-side formula, e.g. facet = fvar1 ~ fvar2. In this case, the facet windows are arranged in a fixed grid layout, with the formula LHS defining the facet rows and the RHS defining the facet columns. At present only single variables on each side of the formula are well supported. (We don’t recommend trying to use multiple variables on either the LHS or RHS of the two-sided formula case.)\n\n\nAs a special “by” convenience keyword, in which case facets will match the grouping variable(s) passed to by above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfacet.args\n\n\nan optional list of arguments for controlling faceting behaviour. (Ignored if facet is NULL.) Supported arguments are as follows:\n\n\nnrow, ncol for overriding the default \"square\" facet window arrangement. Only one of these should be specified, but nrow will take precedence if both are specified together. Ignored if a two-sided formula is passed to the main facet argument, since the layout is arranged in a fixed grid.\n\n\nfree a logical value indicating whether the axis limits (scales) for each individual facet should adjust independently to match the range of the data within that facet. Default is FALSE. Separate free scaling of the x- or y-axis (i.e., whilst holding the other axis fixed) is not currently supported.\n\n\nfmar a vector of form c(b,l,t,r) for controlling the base margin between facets in terms of lines. Defaults to the value of tpar(“fmar”), which should be c(1,1,1,1), i.e. a single line of padding around each individual facet, assuming it hasn’t been overridden by the user as part their global tpar settings. Note some automatic adjustments are made for certain layouts, and depending on whether the plot is framed or not, to reduce excess whitespace. See tpar for more details.\n\n\ncex, font, col, bg, border for adjusting the facet title text and background. Default values for these arguments are inherited from tpar (where they take a \"facet.\" prefix, e.g. tpar(“facet.cex”)). The latter function can also be used to set these features globally for all tinyplot plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata\n\n\na data.frame (or list) from which the variables in formula should be taken. A matrix is converted to a data frame.\n\n\n\n\ntype\n\n\ncharacter string or call to a type_*() function giving the type of plot desired.\n\n\nNULL (default): Choose a sensible type for the type of x and y inputs (i.e., usually “p”).\n\n\n1-character values supported by plot:\n\n\n“p” Points\n\n\n“l” Lines\n\n\n“b” Both points and lines\n\n\n“c” Empty points joined by lines\n\n\n“o” Overplotted points and lines\n\n\n“s” Stair steps\n\n\n“S” Stair steps\n\n\n“h” Histogram-like vertical lines\n\n\n“n” Empty plot over the extent of the data\n\n\n\n\ntinyplot-specific types. These fall into several categories:\n\n\nShapes:\n\n\n“area” / type_area(): Plots the area under the curve from y = 0 to y = f(x).\n\n\n“errorbar” / type_errorbar(): Adds error bars to points; requires ymin and ymax.\n\n\n“pointrange” / type_pointrange(): Combines points with error bars.\n\n\n“polygon” / type_polygon(): Draws polygons.\n\n\n“polypath” / type_polypath(): Draws a path whose vertices are given in x and y.\n\n\n“rect” / type_rect(): Draws rectangles; requires xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax.\n\n\n“ribbon” / type_ribbon(): Creates a filled area between ymin and ymax.\n\n\n“segments” / type_segments(): Draws line segments between pairs of points.\n\n\n“text” / type_text(): Add text annotations.\n\n\n\n\nVisualizations:\n\n\n“boxplot” / type_boxplot(): Creates a box-and-whisker plot.\n\n\n“density” / type_density(): Plots the density estimate of a variable.\n\n\n“histogram” / type_histogram(): Creates a histogram of a single variable.\n\n\n“jitter” / type_jitter(): Jittered points.\n\n\n“qq” / type_qq(): Creates a quantile-quantile plot.\n\n\n“ridge” / type_ridge(): Creates a ridgeline (aka joy) plot.\n\n\n“rug” / type_rug(): Adds a rug to an existing plot.\n\n\n“spineplot” / type_spineplot(): Creates a spineplot or spinogram.\n\n\n\n\nModels:\n\n\n“loess” / type_loess(): Local regression curve.\n\n\n“lm” / type_lm(): Linear regression line.\n\n\n“glm” / type_glm(): Generalized linear model fit.\n\n\n“spline” / type_spline(): Cubic (or Hermite) spline interpolation.\n\n\n\n\nFunctions:\n\n\ntype_abline(): line(s) with intercept and slope.\n\n\ntype_hline(): horizontal line(s).\n\n\ntype_vline(): vertical line(s).\n\n\ntype_function(): arbitrary function.\n\n\ntype_summary(): summarize y by unique values of x.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nxlim\n\n\nthe x limits (x1, x2) of the plot. Note that x1 &gt; x2 is allowed and leads to a ‘reversed axis’. The default value, NULL, indicates that the range of the finite values to be plotted should be used.\n\n\n\n\nylim\n\n\nthe y limits of the plot.\n\n\n\n\nlog\n\n\na character string which contains \"x\" if the x axis is to be logarithmic, \"y\" if the y axis is to be logarithmic and \"xy\" or \"yx\" if both axes are to be logarithmic.\n\n\n\n\nmain\n\n\na main title for the plot, see also title.\n\n\n\n\nsub\n\n\na subtitle for the plot.\n\n\n\n\nxlab\n\n\na label for the x axis, defaults to a description of x.\n\n\n\n\nylab\n\n\na label for the y axis, defaults to a description of y.\n\n\n\n\nann\n\n\na logical value indicating whether the default annotation (title and x and y axis labels) should appear on the plot.\n\n\n\n\naxes\n\n\nlogical or character. Should axes be drawn (TRUE or FALSE)? Or alternatively what type of axes should be drawn: “standard” (with axis, ticks, and labels; equivalent to TRUE), “none” (no axes; equivalent to FALSE), “ticks” (only ticks and labels without axis line), “labels” (only labels without ticks and axis line), “axis” (only axis line and labels but no ticks). To control this separately for the two axes, use the character specifications for xaxt and/or yaxt.\n\n\n\n\nframe.plot\n\n\na logical indicating whether a box should be drawn around the plot. Can also use frame as an acceptable argument alias. The default is to draw a frame if both axis types (set via axes, xaxt, or yaxt) include axis lines.\n\n\n\n\nasp\n\n\nthe y/xy/x aspect ratio, see plot.window.\n\n\n\n\ngrid\n\n\nargument for plotting a background panel grid, one of either:\n\n\na logical (i.e., TRUE to draw the grid), or\n\n\na panel grid plotting function like grid(). Note that this argument replaces the panel.first and panel.last arguments from base plot() and tries to make the process more seamless with better default behaviour. The default behaviour is determined by (and can be set globally through) the value of tpar(“grid”).\n\n\n\n\n\n\npalette\n\n\none of the following options:\n\n\nNULL (default), in which case the palette will be chosen according to the class and cardinality of the \"by\" grouping variable. For non-ordered factors or strings with a reasonable number of groups, this will inherit directly from the user’s default palette (e.g., \"R4\"). In other cases, including ordered factors and high cardinality, the \"Viridis\" palette will be used instead. Note that a slightly restricted version of the \"Viridis\" palette—where extreme color values have been trimmed to improve visual perception—will be used for ordered factors and continuous variables. In the latter case of a continuous grouping variable, we also generate a gradient legend swatch.\n\n\nA convenience string corresponding to one of the many palettes listed by either palette.pals() or hcl.pals(). Note that the string can be case-insensitive (e.g., \"Okabe-Ito\" and \"okabe-ito\" are both valid).\n\n\nA palette-generating function. This can be \"bare\" (e.g., palette.colors) or \"closed\" with a set of named arguments (e.g., palette.colors(palette = “Okabe-Ito”, alpha = 0.5)). Note that any unnamed arguments will be ignored and the key n argument, denoting the number of colours, will automatically be spliced in as the number of groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlegend\n\n\none of the following options:\n\n\nNULL (default), in which case the legend will be determined by the grouping variable. If there is no group variable (i.e., by is NULL) then no legend is drawn. If a grouping variable is detected, then an automatic legend is drawn to the outer right of the plotting area. Note that the legend title and categories will automatically be inferred from the by argument and underlying data.\n\n\nA convenience string indicating the legend position. The string should correspond to one of the position keywords supported by the base legend function, e.g. \"right\", \"topleft\", \"bottom\", etc. In addition, tinyplot supports adding a trailing exclamation point to these keywords, e.g. \"right!\", \"topleft!\", or \"bottom!\". This will place the legend outside the plotting area and adjust the margins of the plot accordingly. Finally, users can also turn off any legend printing by specifying \"none\".\n\n\nLogical value, where TRUE corresponds to the default case above (same effect as specifying NULL) and FALSE turns the legend off (same effect as specifying \"none\").\n\n\nA list or, equivalently, a dedicated legend() function with supported legend arguments, e.g. \"bty\", \"horiz\", and so forth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npch\n\n\nplotting \"character\", i.e., symbol to use. Character, integer, or vector of length equal to the number of categories in the by variable. See pch. In addition, users can supply a special pch = “by” convenience argument, in which case the characters will automatically loop over the number groups. This automatic looping will begin at the global character value (i.e., par(“pch”)) and recycle as necessary.\n\n\n\n\nlty\n\n\nline type. Character, integer, or vector of length equal to the number of categories in the by variable. See lty. In addition, users can supply a special lty = “by” convenience argument, in which case the line type will automatically loop over the number groups. This automatic looping will begin at the global line type value (i.e., par(“lty”)) and recycle as necessary.\n\n\n\n\nlwd\n\n\nline width. Numeric scalar or vector of length equal to the number of categories in the by variable. See lwd. In addition, users can supply a special lwd = “by” convenience argument, in which case the line width will automatically loop over the number of groups. This automatic looping will be centered at the global line width value (i.e.,\n\n\n\n\ncol\n\n\nplotting color. Character, integer, or vector of length equal to the number of categories in the by variable. See col. Note that the default behaviour in tinyplot is to vary group colors along any variables declared in the by argument. Thus, specifying colors manually should not be necessary unless users wish to override the automatic colors produced by this grouping process. Typically, this would only be done if grouping features are deferred to some other graphical parameter (i.e., passing the \"by\" keyword to one of pch, lty, lwd, or bg; see below.)\n\n\n\n\nbg\n\n\nbackground fill color for the open plot symbols 21:25 (see points.default), as well as ribbon and area plot types. Users can also supply either one of two special convenience arguments that will cause the background fill to inherit the automatic grouped coloring behaviour of col:\n\n\nbg = “by” will insert a background fill that inherits the main color mappings from col.\n\n\nby = &lt;numeric[0,1]&gt; (i.e., a numeric in the range [0,1]) will insert a background fill that inherits the main color mapping(s) from col, but with added alpha-transparency.\n\n\nFor both of these convenience arguments, note that the (grouped) bg mappings will persist even if the (grouped) col defaults are themselves overridden. This can be useful if you want to preserve the grouped palette mappings by background fill but not boundary color, e.g. filled points. See examples.\n\n\n\n\nfill\n\n\nalias for bg. If non-NULL values for both bg and fill are provided, then the latter will be ignored in favour of the former.\n\n\n\n\nalpha\n\n\na numeric in the range [0,1] for adjusting the alpha channel of the color palette, where 0 means transparent and 1 means opaque. Use fractional values, e.g. 0.5 for semi-transparency.\n\n\n\n\ncex\n\n\ncharacter expansion. A numerical vector (can be a single value) giving the amount by which plotting characters and symbols should be scaled relative to the default. Note that NULL is equivalent to 1.0, while NA renders the characters invisible.\n\n\n\n\nrestore.par\n\n\na logical value indicating whether the par settings prior to calling tinyplot should be restored on exit. Defaults to FALSE, which makes it possible to add elements to the plot after it has been drawn. However, note the the outer margins of the graphics device may have been altered to make space for the tinyplot legend. Users can opt out of this persistent behaviour by setting to TRUE instead. See also get_saved_par for another option to recover the original par settings, as well as longer discussion about the trade-offs involved.\n\n\n\n\nxmin, xmax, ymin, ymax\n\n\nminimum and maximum coordinates of relevant area or interval plot types. Only used when the type argument is one of “rect” or “segments” (where all four min-max coordinates are required), or “pointrange”, “errorbar”, or “ribbon” (where only ymin and ymax required alongside x).\n\n\n\n\nadd\n\n\nlogical. If TRUE, then elements are added to the current plot rather than drawing a new plot window. Note that the automatic legend for the added elements will be turned off. See also tinyplot_add, which provides a convenient wrapper around this functionality for layering on top of an existing plot without having to repeat arguments.\n\n\n\n\ndraw\n\n\na function that draws directly on the plot canvas (before x and y are plotted). The draw argument is primarily useful for adding common elements to each facet of a faceted plot, e.g. abline or text. Note that this argument is somewhat experimental and that no internal checking is done for correctness; the provided argument is simply captured and evaluated as-is. See Examples.\n\n\n\n\nfile\n\n\ncharacter string giving the file path for writing a plot to disk. If specified, the plot will not be displayed interactively, but rather sent to the appropriate external graphics device (i.e., png, jpeg, pdf, or svg). As a point of convenience, note that any global parameters held in (t)par are automatically carried over to the external device and don’t need to be reset (in contrast to the conventional base R approach that requires manually opening and closing the device). The device type is determined by the file extension at the end of the provided path, and must be one of \".png\", \".jpg\" (\".jpeg\"), \".pdf\", or \".svg\". (Other file types may be supported in the future.) The file dimensions can be controlled by the corresponding width and height arguments below, otherwise will fall back to the “file.width” and “file.height” values held in tpar (i.e., both defaulting to 7 inches, and where the default resolution for bitmap files is also specified as 300 DPI).\n\n\n\n\nwidth\n\n\nnumeric giving the plot width in inches. Together with height, typically used in conjunction with the file argument above, overriding the default values held in tpar(“file.width”, “file.height”). If either width or height is specified, but a corresponding file argument is not provided as well, then a new interactive graphics device dimensions will be opened along the given dimensions. Note that this interactive resizing may not work consistently from within an IDE like RStudio that has an integrated graphics windows.\n\n\n\n\nheight\n\n\nnumeric giving the plot height in inches. Same considerations as width (above) apply, e.g. will default to tpar(“file.height”) if not specified.\n\n\n\n\nempty\n\n\nlogical indicating whether the interior plot region should be left empty. The default is FALSE. Setting to TRUE has a similar effect to invoking type = “n” above, except that any legend artifacts owing to a particular plot type (e.g., lines for type = “l” or squares for type = “area”) will still be drawn correctly alongside the empty plot. In contrast,type = “n” implicitly assumes a scatterplot and so any legend will only depict points.\n\n\n\n\nxaxt, yaxt\n\n\ncharacter specifying the type of x-axis and y-axis, respectively. See axes for the possible values.\n\n\n\n\nflip\n\n\nlogical. Should the plot orientation be flipped, so that the y-axis is on the horizontal plane and the x-axis is on the vertical plane? Default is FALSE.\n\n\n\n\nxaxs, yaxs\n\n\ncharacter specifying the style of the interval calculation used for the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. See par for the possible values.\n\n\n\n\nformula\n\n\na formula that optionally includes grouping variable(s) after a vertical bar, e.g. y ~ x | z. One-sided formulae are also permitted, e.g. ~ y | z. Multiple grouping variables can be specified in different ways, e.g. y ~ x | z1:z2 or y ~ x | z1 + z2. (These two representations are treated as equivalent; both are parsed as interaction(z1, z2) internally.) Note that the formula and x arguments should not be specified in the same call.\n\n\n\n\nsubset, na.action, drop.unused.levels\n\n\narguments passed to model.frame when extracting the data from formula and data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisregarding the enhancements that it supports, tinyplot tries as far as possible to mimic the behaviour and syntax logic of the original base plot function. Users should therefore be able to swap out existing plot calls for tinyplot (or its shorthand alias plt), without causing unexpected changes to the output.\n\n\n\nNo return value, called for side effect of producing a plot.\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(\"tinyplot\")\n\n#'\naq = transform(\n  airquality,\n  Month = factor(Month, labels = month.abb[unique(Month)])\n)\n\n# In most cases, `tinyplot` should be a drop-in replacement for regular\n# `plot` calls.

    "text": "If you are viewing this file on CRAN, please check the latest NEWS on our website where the formatting is also better.\n\n\nNew features:\n\ntinyplot(..., file = \"*.pdf\") will now default to using cairo_pdf() if cairo graphics are supported on the user’s machine. This should help to ensure better fidelity of (non-standard) fonts in PDFs. (#311 @grantcdermott)\n\nBugs fixes:\n\nThe cex argument should be respected when using type=\"bg\". Thanks to @rjknell for report #307 and @vincentarelbundock for the fix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntinyplot v0.3.0 is a big release with many new features, both internal and user-facing. Related updates are grouped below for easier navigation.\n\n\n(Primary PR and author: #222 @vincentarelbundock)\n\nIn addition to the standard character labels (\"p\", \"density\", etc.), the type argument now supports functional equivalents (type_points(), type_density(), etc.). These new functional types all take the form type_*().\nThe character and functional types are interchangeable. For example,\ntinyplot(Nile, type = \"hist\")\nand\ntinyplot(Nile, type = type_hist())\nproduce exactly the same result.\nThe main advantage of the functional type_*() variants is that they offer much more flexibility and control beyond the default case(s). Users can pass appropriate arguments to existing types for customization and can even define their own type_&lt;typename&gt;() functions. More information is available in the dedicated help page for each type (e.g., ?type_hist, ?type_lm, etc.)\nOn the development side, overhauling the type system has also allowed us to introduce a number of new plot types and features (see list below). We have also simplified our internal codebase, since explicit argument passing requires less guesswork on our end. Speaking of which, we now recommended that users explicitly pass ancillary type-specific arguments as part of the relevant type_*() call. For example,\ntinyplot(Nile, type = type_hist(breaks = 30))\nis preferable to\ntinyplot(Nile, type = \"hist\", breaks = 30)\nWhile the latter option will still work, we cannot guarantee that argument passing will work in every situation. (Reason: Passing ancillary type-specific arguments at the top level of the plot call only works if these do not conflict with the main arguments of the tinyplot() function itself; see #267.)\nSome minor breaking changes were unavoidable; see further below.\nFor more details on the new type system, please see the dedicated Plot types vignette on the website.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizations:\n\ntype_spineplot() (shortcut: \"spineplot\") spine plots and spinograms. These are modified versions of a histogram or mosaic plot, and are particularly useful for visualizing factor variables. (#233 @zeileis with contributions from @grantmcdermott)\ntype_qq() (shortcut: “qq”) for quantile-quantile plots. (#251 @vincentarelbundock)\ntype_ridge() (shortcut: \"ridge\") for ridge plots aka Joy plots.

Instead, please rather call tinyplot(..., type = \"density\") or tinyplot(..., type = type_density()) on the raw data and pass grouping or facet arguments as needed. (#284 @grantmcdermott)\n\nThe ribbon.alpha argument in tinyplot() has been deprecated. Use the alpha argument in type_ribbon() (and equivalents) instead: e.g., tinyplot(..., type = type_ribbon(alpha = 0.5)).\n\nAside: Please note that this is not equivalent to using tinyplot(..., type = \"ribbon\", alpha = 0.5) because the latter matches the top-level alpha argument of tinyplot() itself (and thus modifies the entire palette, rather than just the ribbon).

In addition to the existing logical (TRUE/FALSE) option, users can now specify one of the following character keywords (or, just their first letters as a convenient shorthand):\n\n\"standard\" (with axis, ticks, and labels; equivalent to TRUE),\n\"none\" (no axes; equivalent to FALSE),\n\"ticks\" (only ticks and labels without axis line),\n\"labels\" (only labels without ticks and axis line),\n\"axis\" (only axis line and labels but no ticks).\n\nSimultaneously, the main plotting functions also gain the xaxt and yaxt for separately controlling the two axes using the same keyword options. For example, plt(0:10, xaxt = \"l\", yaxt = \"t\") will yield a plot where the x-axis only contains labels and the y-axis contains both labels and ticks, but no axis line. (#190 @zeileis)\nSupport additional boxplot arguments like varwidth, notch, etc. Note that tinyplot(..., type = \"boxplot\", boxwidth = &lt;num&gt;) is equivalent to the boxplot(..., width = &lt;num&gt;); we just use the “box(width)” prefix to avoid conflicting with the existing tinyplot(..., width) argument. (#196 @grantmcdermott)\n\nBug fixes:\n\nFix duplicate plots produced with type = \"density\", which was a regression accidentally introduced in v0.2.0 (#187 @grantmcdermott)\nEnsure correct boxplot positioning if x == by, or these two are functionally identical.

(#197 @zeileis)\nFacets with interactions and/or multivariate formulas (e.g., complex grid arrangements like tinyplot(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars, facet = am + vs ~ gear)) now plot all panels correctly, even if some combinations are missing. (#197 @grantmcdermott)\nFix alignment of facet titles when axes are logged. (#207 @grantmcdermott)\nConsistent decimals for gradient legends (#277 @grantmcdermott)\n\nInternals:\n\nContinued modularization of the main code logic. (#192 & #198 @vincentarelbundock)\nRevamped formula processing that allows for better sanity checking and edge-case logic. (#197 @zeileis)\n\n\n\n\nNew features:\n\nSupport for additional plot types:\n\ntype = \"n\", i.e. empty plot. Since type = \"n\" implicitly assumes points, which limits the type of legend that can be drawn alongside the empty plot, we have also added a companion empty argument that can be used alongside any plot type. (#157, #167 @grantmcdermott)\ntype = \"boxplot\". Simultaneously enables plt(numeric ~ factor) support, first raised in #2, so that a boxplot is automatically plotted if a numeric is plotted against a factor. (#154 @grantmcdermott)\ntype = \"polypath\". (#159 @grantmcdermott)\ntype = \"rect\". (#161 @grantmcdermott)\ntype = \"segments\". (#163 @grantmcdermott)\ntype = \"histogram\" (alias type = \"hist\"). (#164 @grantmcdermott)\ntype = \"jitter\" (alias type = \"j\"). (#170 @grantmcdermott)\n\n\nInternals:\n\nThe main codebase has been significantly refactored (modularized), which should simplify future maintenance and enable better user-level error messages (#171, #173 @vincentarelbundock)\n\nMisc:\n\nVarious documentation improvements.\n\n\n\n\nOur first CRAN submission! This v0.1.0 release includes the following new features and updates:\nLicense:\n\nFormally switch to Apache 2.0 license. (#141 @grantmcdermott)\n\nBreaking changes:\n\nTo ensure consistent “dot.case” style for all tinyplot() function arguments, the following two arguments have been renamed (old =&gt; new):\n\npar_restore =&gt; restore.par (note the change in word order too!)\nribbon_alpha =&gt; ribbon.alpha\n\nWe don’t believe that these two arguments are much used in practice. So hopefully it will only have a negligible effect on existing tinyplot code in the wild, even though it is a breaking change. (#149 @grantmcdermott)\n\nNew features:\n\nGradient legends are now supported if a continuous variable is passed to by. Thanks to @zeileis for detailed feedback and advice around the default palette choice (a restricted version of the “viridis” palette), as well as StackOverflow user mnel, whose answer here provided the inspiration for the final implementation. (#122 @grantmcdermott)\nOrdered factors now inherit a discrete sequential color palette (“viridis”) by default. Thanks to @zeileis for the suggestion. (#130 @grantmcdermott)\nSupport user-supplied polygons. (#127 @grantmcdermott)\nSupport for the lwd argument for adjusting line widths. Similar to pch, lty, etc. this arguments also accepts a “by” convenience keyword to automatically vary line widths by group. (#134 @grantmcdermott)\ntpar() now accepts standard par() arguments in addition to the tinyplot-specific ones. This allows users to set or query graphical parameters via a single convenience function, instead having to invoke tpar and par separately. (#140 @grantmcdermott)\n\nAs an aside, tpar() has gained some additional parameters for fine-grained control of global plot defaults, including grid, ribbon.alpha, and various file.* parameters (see next bullet point).\n\nUsers can write plots directly to disk using the new file argument, alongside corresponding width and height arguments for output customization (both of which are defined in inches). For example, tinyplot(..., file = \"~/myplot.png\", width = 8, height = 5). This implementation relies on a simple internal wrapper around the traditional R external graphics devices like png(), pdf(), etc. But it may prove more convenient, since the current global graphics parameters held in (t)par() are carried over to the external device too and don’t need to be reset. Note that the appropriate device type is determined automatically by the file extension, which must be one of “.png”, “.jpg” (“.jpeg”), “.pdf”, or “.svg”. (#143 @grantmcdermott)\nWe have a shiny new tinyplot logo. (#148 @grantmcdermott)\nThe new get_saved_par() function can be used to retrieve the par settings from immediately before or immediately after the preceding tinyplot call. This function replaces some older (non-exported) internal functions that tinyplot was using to restore and control par environments. But it could also prove help to end users who are looking for additional ways to restore par settings after the fact. See ?get_saved_par for some examples. (#152 @grantmcdermott)\ntinyplot/plt gaina a new alpha = &lt;numeric[0,1]&gt; convenience argument for adding transparency to plot elements and colours. Example use: plt(rnorm(1e3), pch = 19, alpha = 0.3). (#129 @grantmcdermott)\nSimilar to the preceding news item, transparency can be added to (grouped) background fill by passing bg (or its alias, fill) a numeric in the range [0,1]. This feature has the same effect as bg = \"by\" except for the added transparency. Example use: tinyplot(lat ~ long | depth, data = quakes, pch = 21, cex = 2, bg = 0.2). (#129 @grantmcdermott)\n\nBug fixes:\n\nFixed bug that prevented tpar(facet.x = ...) args from being passed forward and set correctly. (#137 @grantmcdermott)\nFixed bug where custom legends weren’t working with type = \"density\". (#147 @grantmcdermott)\n\nInternals:\n\nWe no longer ship the vignette(s) with the built package. This helps to reduce the size of the installation tarball and also avoids some redundancy with the actual help documentation (since many of the examples are the same). Note that the vignettes are all still rendered and available online at the tinyplot website. (#135 @grantmcdermott)\nSimilarly, we anticipate skipping tests on CRAN since the large suite of test snapshots (images) held in inst/tinytest is pushing the install tarball over CRAN’s recommended 5 MB limit. Please note that local testing of the package requires adding the NOT_CRAN=TRUE environment variable to your .Renviron file (or, exporting it in your .bashrc/.zshrc/etc. dotfile if you prefer that approach). (#145 @vincentarelbundock & @grantmcdermott)\nUpdate some test snapshots to match slight changes in the way that R 4.4.0 calculates density grid coords. (#150 @grantmcdermott)\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT BREAKING CHANGE:\nThe package has been renamed to tinyplot. (#22 @grantmcdermott)\nThis package renaming also incorporates the following function changes:\n\nplot2() is replaced by tinyplot() (or its shorthand alias plt()).\npar2() is replaced by tpar().\n\nSo, where you used to write…\nlibrary(plot2)\nplot2(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length | Species, iris)\n… you should now write:\nlibrary(tinyplot)\ntinyplot(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length | Species, iris)\n\n# Or, use the equivalent shorthand `plt` alias\nplt(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length | Species, iris)\nThe package URLs have been updated accordingly:\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/grantmcdermott/tinyplot\nWebsite: https://grantmcdermott.com/tinyplot\nR-universe: https://grantmcdermott.r-universe.dev/tinyplot\n\nMany thanks to everyone who provided thoughtful feedback about this prospective name change, especially @zeileis and @vincentarelbundock for kicking off the discussion, as well as the 100+ participants who voted in the social media poll.\nFor more details about the rational underlying this renaming decision, please see the following GitHub comment, as well as the discussion that preceded it: https://github.com/grantmcdermott/plot2/issues/22#issuecomment-1928472754\n\n\n\nWebsite:\nWe now have a dedicated website! (#80 @vincentarelbundock)\nNew features:\n\nSupport for cex and bg (alias fill) arguments. The latter also permit the “by” convenience keyword similar to lty and pch. This is useful for plotting filled point characters (e.g., pch = 21), where you want a different colour for the fill and border. (#50, #75 @grantmcdermott)\nSupport for filled density plots. (#58 @grantmcdermott)\nThe new add argument allows new plot2 objects to be added to / on top of the existing plot window. (#60 @grantmcdermott)\nSupport for one-sided formulas, e.g. plot2(~ Temp | Month, airquality). (#62 @grantmcdermott and @zeileis)\nSupport for plot2(x, type = \"density\") as an alternative to plot2(density(x)). Works for both the atomic and one-sided formula methods. (#66 @grantmcdermott)\nSupport for “area” type plots as a special case of ribbon plots. (#68 @grantmcdermott)\nPartial matching for palette keywords. (#74 @grantmcdermott)\nplot2 gains a new facet argument for drawing faceted plots. Users can override the default square arrangement by passing the desired number of facet rows or columns to the companion facet.args helper function. Facets can be combined with by grouping, or used on their own. (#83, #91, #94, #96, #101, #103 @grantmcdermott)\nUsers can now control plot2-specific graphical parameters globally via the new par2() function (which is modeled on the base par() function). At the moment only a subset of global parameters, mostly related to legend and facet behaviour, are exposed in par2. But users can expect that more will be added in future releases. (#33, #94 @grantmcdermott)\n\nBug fixes:\n\nY-label correctly prints if a function was used for the atomic plot method, e.g. plot2(rnorm(100). (#52 etiennebacher)\nRibbon plot types are now automatically ordered by the x variable. (#54 @grantmcdermott)\nInterval plots like ribbons, errorbars, and pointranges are now correctly plotted even if a y variable isn’t specified. (#54 @grantmcdermott)\nCorrectly label date-time axes. (#77 @grantmcdermott and @zeileis)\nImproved consistency of legend and facet margins across different plot types and placement, via the new lmar and fmar arguments of par2(). The default legend margin is par2(lmar = c(1,0, 0.1), which means that there is 1.0 line of padding between the legend and the plot region (inside margin) and 0.1 line of padding between the legend and edge of the graphics device (outer margin). Similarly, the default facet padding is par2(fmar = c(1,1,1,1), which means that there is a single line of padding around each side of the individual facets. Users can override these defaults by passing numeric vectors of the appropriate length to par2(). For example, par2(lmar = c(0,0.1) would shrink the inner gap between the legend and plot region to zero, but leave the small outer gap to outside of the graphics device unchanged. (#94 @grantmcdermott)\nFix bug where grid wasn’t auto-expanding correctly for area plots. (#92 @grantmcdermott)\n\n\n\n\nBreaking changes:\n\nColour palettes are now controlled via a single palette argument that unifies the old palette and (deprecated) palette.args arguments. In addition, the default palette for small groups has been changed from “Okabe-Ito” to “R4”. (#31 and #32 @grantmcdermott)\nLegends are now controlled via a single legend argument that unifies the previous (deprecated) legend.position and legend.args arguments. This change also enables several enhancements over the old legend behaviour; see below. (#34 @grantmcdermott)\n\nNew features:\n\nAdd support for the argument log. (#15 @etiennebacher)\nAdd support for grouped density plots. (#18 @grantmcdermott)\nAdd support for (both grouped and non-grouped) “c”, “h”, “s”, and “S” types. (#26 @grantmcdermott)\nBoth the pch and lty arguments now accept a “by” convenience keyword for automatically adjusting plot characters and line types by groups. (#28 @grantmcdermott)\nAdd outside (“!”) placement support for remaining legend keywords, e.g. “top!”, “left!”, “topright!”, etc. Users also gain finer control over many other aspects of the legend via the new unified legend argument, including changing labels, turning of the legend title, and so on. (#34 @grantmcdermott)\nAdd support for \"pointrange\", \"errobar\", and \"ribbon\" plot types. (#35 @vincentarelbundock, #40 and #46 @grantmcdermott)\nSupport grid = TRUE as an alternative to grid = grid(). (#43 @grantmcdermott)\n\nBug fixes:\n\nSetting par(pch=X) globally is now respected. (#20 @grantmcdermott)\nFix x-axis scale/index when y is NULL. (#24 @grantmcdermott)\nSetting a global palette, e.g. palette(\"ggplot2\") is now respected. (#44 @grantmcdermott)\n\n\n\n\nBreaking changes:\n\nLegend defaults have been changed. The default position is now “right!” and drawn without a border, i.e. bty = “n” (#14 by @grantmcdermott).\n\nNew features:\n\nAllow users to specify different pch, lty, and col types per group (#5 and #11 by @vincentarelbundock).\n\nBug fixes:\n\nAdding further elements to plot2 now works (#13 by @grantmcdermott, thanks @karoliskoncevicius for reporting).\n\nInternals:\n\nBetter formula parsing for plot2.formula (#8 by @zeileis).\nUnit testing scaffolding based on tinysnaphot (#11 by @vincent).\n\nProject:\n\n@vincentarelbundock and @zeileis have joined the project as core contributors. 🎉\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial release on GitHub.",

    "text": "tinyplot v0.3.0 is a big release with many new features, both internal and user-facing. Related updates are grouped below for easier navigation.\n\n\n(Primary PR and author: #222 @vincentarelbundock)\n\nIn addition to the standard character labels (\"p\", \"density\", etc.), the type argument now supports functional equivalents (type_points(), type_density(), etc.). These new functional types all take the form type_*().\nThe character and functional types are interchangeable. For example,\ntinyplot(Nile, type = \"hist\")\nand\ntinyplot(Nile, type = type_hist())\nproduce exactly the same result.\nThe main advantage of the functional type_*() variants is that they offer much more flexibility and control beyond the default case(s). Users can pass appropriate arguments to existing types for customization and can even define their own type_&lt;typename&gt;() functions. More information is available in the dedicated help page for each type (e.g., ?type_hist, ?type_lm, etc.)\nOn the development side, overhauling the type system has also allowed us to introduce a number of new plot types and features (see list below). We have also simplified our internal codebase, since explicit argument passing requires less guesswork on our end. Speaking of which, we now recommended that users explicitly pass ancillary type-specific arguments as part of the relevant type_*() call. For example,\ntinyplot(Nile, type = type_hist(breaks = 30))\nis preferable to\ntinyplot(Nile, type = \"hist\", breaks = 30)\nWhile the latter option will still work, we cannot guarantee that argument passing will work in every situation. (Reason: Passing ancillary type-specific arguments at the top level of the plot call only works if these do not conflict with the main arguments of the tinyplot() function itself; see #267.)\nSome minor breaking changes were unavoidable; see further below.\nFor more details on the new type system, please see the dedicated Plot types vignette on the website.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizations:\n\ntype_spineplot() (shortcut: \"spineplot\") spine plots and spinograms. These are modified versions of a histogram or mosaic plot, and are particularly useful for visualizing factor variables. (#233 @zeileis with contributions from @grantmcdermott)\ntype_qq() (shortcut: “qq”) for quantile-quantile plots. (#251 @vincentarelbundock)\ntype_ridge() (shortcut: \"ridge\") for ridge plots aka Joy plots. (#252 @vincentarelbundock, @zeileis, and @grantmcdermott)\ntype_rug() (shortcut: \"rug\") adds a rug to an existing plot. (#276 @grantmcdermott)\ntype_text() (shortcut: \"text\") adds text annotations. @vincentarelbundock)\n\nModels:\n\ntype_glm() (shortcut: \"glm\") @vincentarelbundock)\ntype_lm() (shortcut: \"lm\") @vincentarelbundock)\ntype_loess() (shortcut: \"loess\") @vincentarelbundock)\ntype_spline() (shortcut: \"spline\") (#241 @grantmcdermott)\n\nFunctions:\n\ntype_abline(): line(s) with intercept and slope (#249 @vincentarelbundock)\ntype_hline(): horizontal line(s) (#249 @vincentarelbundock)\ntype_vline(): vertical line(s) (#249 @vincentarelbundock)\ntype_function(): arbitrary function. (#250 @vincentarelbundock)\ntype_summary(): summarize values of y along unique values of x (#274 @grantmcdermott)\n\n\n\n\n\n(Primary PR and authors: #258 @vincentarelbundock and @grantmcdermott)\n\nThe new tinytheme() function provides a convenient mechanism for styling plots according to a variety of pre-defined themes, e.g. tinytheme(\"clean\").\nUsers can also add their own custom themes or tweak an existing theme.\nThemes are persistent and will affect all subsequent plots until they are explicitly reset, e.g. by calling tinytheme() (with no argument) to restore the default plot aesthetic.\nBehind the scenes, tinytheme() sets a hook for a group graphical parameters by passing them through tpar().

(#237 @grantmcdermott)\nThe new tinyplot_add() (alias: plt_add()) convenience function allows easy layering of plots without having to specify repeat arguments. (#246 @vincentarelbundock)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few breaking changes to grouped density plots.\n\nThe joint smoothing bandwidth is now computed using an observation-weighted mean (as opposed to a simple mean).

Instead, please rather call tinyplot(..., type = \"density\") or tinyplot(..., type = type_density()) on the raw data and pass grouping or facet arguments as needed. (#284 @grantmcdermott)\n\nThe ribbon.alpha argument in tinyplot() has been deprecated. Use the alpha argument in type_ribbon() (and equivalents) instead: e.g., tinyplot(..., type = type_ribbon(alpha = 0.5)).\n\nAside: Please note that this is not equivalent to using tinyplot(..., type = \"ribbon\", alpha = 0.5) because the latter matches the top-level alpha argument of tinyplot() itself (and thus modifies the entire palette, rather than just the ribbon). See our warning about passing ancillary type-specific arguments above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter preserve facet attributes, thus avoiding misarrangement of facet grids for density and histogram types. (#209 @zeileis)\nPlots of the form plt(numeric ~ character) now work correctly, with the character variable automatically being coerced to a factor.

    "text": "New Features:\n\nThe axes argument of tinyplot()/plt() gains extra options for fine-grained control of the plot axes. In addition to the existing logical (TRUE/FALSE) option, users can now specify one of the following character keywords (or, just their first letters as a convenient shorthand):\n\n\"standard\" (with axis, ticks, and labels; equivalent to TRUE),\n\"none\" (no axes; equivalent to FALSE),\n\"ticks\" (only ticks and labels without axis line),\n\"labels\" (only labels without ticks and axis line),\n\"axis\" (only axis line and labels but no ticks).\n\nSimultaneously, the main plotting functions also gain the xaxt and yaxt for separately controlling the two axes using the same keyword options. For example, plt(0:10, xaxt = \"l\", yaxt = \"t\") will yield a plot where the x-axis only contains labels and the y-axis contains both labels and ticks, but no axis line. (#190 @zeileis)\nSupport additional boxplot arguments like varwidth, notch, etc. Note that tinyplot(..., type = \"boxplot\", boxwidth = &lt;num&gt;) is equivalent to the boxplot(..., width = &lt;num&gt;); we just use the “box(width)” prefix to avoid conflicting with the existing tinyplot(..., width) argument. (#196 @grantmcdermott)\n\nBug fixes:\n\nFix duplicate plots produced with type = \"density\", which was a regression accidentally introduced in v0.2.0 (#187 @grantmcdermott)\nEnsure correct boxplot positioning if x == by, or these two are functionally identical. (#196 @grantmcdermott)\nxlab and ylab arguments not respected in some plots. Thanks to @lbelzile for reporting Issue #203.\nAvoid triggering an inadvertent legend when a function transformation of x is plotted against x itself, tinyplot(log(x) ~ x). (#197 @zeileis)\nFacets with interactions and/or multivariate formulas (e.g., complex grid arrangements like tinyplot(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars, facet = am + vs ~ gear)) now plot all panels correctly, even if some combinations are missing.

    "text": "Our first CRAN submission! This v0.1.0 release includes the following new features and updates:\nLicense:\n\nFormally switch to Apache 2.0 license. (#141 @grantmcdermott)\n\nBreaking changes:\n\nTo ensure consistent “dot.case” style for all tinyplot() function arguments, the following two arguments have been renamed (old =&gt; new):\n\npar_restore =&gt; restore.par (note the change in word order too!)\nribbon_alpha =&gt; ribbon.alpha\n\nWe don’t believe that these two arguments are much used in practice. So hopefully it will only have a negligible effect on existing tinyplot code in the wild, even though it is a breaking change. (#149 @grantmcdermott)\n\nNew features:\n\nGradient legends are now supported if a continuous variable is passed to by. Thanks to @zeileis for detailed feedback and advice around the default palette choice (a restricted version of the “viridis” palette), as well as StackOverflow user mnel, whose answer here provided the inspiration for the final implementation. (#122 @grantmcdermott)\nOrdered factors now inherit a discrete sequential color palette (“viridis”) by default. Thanks to @zeileis for the suggestion. (#130 @grantmcdermott)\nSupport user-supplied polygons. (#127 @grantmcdermott)\nSupport for the lwd argument for adjusting line widths. Similar to pch, lty, etc. this arguments also accepts a “by” convenience keyword to automatically vary line widths by group. (#134 @grantmcdermott)\ntpar() now accepts standard par() arguments in addition to the tinyplot-specific ones. This allows users to set or query graphical parameters via a single convenience function, instead having to invoke tpar and par separately. (#140 @grantmcdermott)\n\nAs an aside, tpar() has gained some additional parameters for fine-grained control of global plot defaults, including grid, ribbon.alpha, and various file.* parameters (see next bullet point).\n\nUsers can write plots directly to disk using the new file argument, alongside corresponding width and height arguments for output customization (both of which are defined in inches). For example, tinyplot(..., file = \"~/myplot.png\", width = 8, height = 5). This implementation relies on a simple internal wrapper around the traditional R external graphics devices like png(), pdf(), etc. But it may prove more convenient, since the current global graphics parameters held in (t)par() are carried over to the external device too and don’t need to be reset. Note that the appropriate device type is determined automatically by the file extension, which must be one of “.png”, “.jpg” (“.jpeg”), “.pdf”, or “.svg”. (#143 @grantmcdermott)\nWe have a shiny new tinyplot logo. (#148 @grantmcdermott)\nThe new get_saved_par() function can be used to retrieve the par settings from immediately before or immediately after the preceding tinyplot call. This function replaces some older (non-exported) internal functions that tinyplot was using to restore and control par environments. But it could also prove help to end users who are looking for additional ways to restore par settings after the fact. See ?get_saved_par for some examples. (#152 @grantmcdermott)\ntinyplot/plt gaina a new alpha = &lt;numeric[0,1]&gt; convenience argument for adding transparency to plot elements and colours. Example use: plt(rnorm(1e3), pch = 19, alpha = 0.3). (#129 @grantmcdermott)\nSimilar to the preceding news item, transparency can be added to (grouped) background fill by passing bg (or its alias, fill) a numeric in the range [0,1]. This feature has the same effect as bg = \"by\" except for the added transparency. Example use: tinyplot(lat ~ long | depth, data = quakes, pch = 21, cex = 2, bg = 0.2). (#129 @grantmcdermott)\n\nBug fixes:\n\nFixed bug that prevented tpar(facet.x = ...) args from being passed forward and set correctly. (#137 @grantmcdermott)\nFixed bug where custom legends weren’t working with type = \"density\". (#147 @grantmcdermott)\n\nInternals:\n\nWe no longer ship the vignette(s) with the built package. This helps to reduce the size of the installation tarball and also avoids some redundancy with the actual help documentation (since many of the examples are the same). Note that the vignettes are all still rendered and available online at the tinyplot website. (#135 @grantmcdermott)\nSimilarly, we anticipate skipping tests on CRAN since the large suite of test snapshots (images) held in inst/tinytest is pushing the install tarball over CRAN’s recommended 5 MB limit. Please note that local testing of the package requires adding the NOT_CRAN=TRUE environment variable to your .Renviron file (or, exporting it in your .bashrc/.zshrc/etc. dotfile if you prefer that approach). (#145 @vincentarelbundock & @grantmcdermott)\nUpdate some test snapshots to match slight changes in the way that R 4.4.0 calculates density grid coords. (#150 @grantmcdermott)",

    "text": "IMPORTANT BREAKING CHANGE:\nThe package has been renamed to tinyplot. (#22 @grantmcdermott)\nThis package renaming also incorporates the following function changes:\n\nplot2() is replaced by tinyplot() (or its shorthand alias plt()).\npar2() is replaced by tpar().\n\nSo, where you used to write…\nlibrary(plot2)\nplot2(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length | Species, iris)\n… you should now write:\nlibrary(tinyplot)\ntinyplot(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length | Species, iris)\n\n# Or, use the equivalent shorthand `plt` alias\nplt(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length | Species, iris)\nThe package URLs have been updated accordingly:\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/grantmcdermott/tinyplot\nWebsite: https://grantmcdermott.com/tinyplot\nR-universe: https://grantmcdermott.r-universe.dev/tinyplot\n\nMany thanks to everyone who provided thoughtful feedback about this prospective name change, especially @zeileis and @vincentarelbundock for kicking off the discussion, as well as the 100+ participants who voted in the social media poll.\nFor more details about the rational underlying this renaming decision, please see the following GitHub comment, as well as the discussion that preceded it: https://github.com/grantmcdermott/plot2/issues/22#issuecomment-1928472754",

    "text": "Website:\nWe now have a dedicated website! (#80 @vincentarelbundock)\nNew features:\n\nSupport for cex and bg (alias fill) arguments. The latter also permit the “by” convenience keyword similar to lty and pch. This is useful for plotting filled point characters (e.g., pch = 21), where you want a different colour for the fill and border. (#50, #75 @grantmcdermott)\nSupport for filled density plots. (#58 @grantmcdermott)\nThe new add argument allows new plot2 objects to be added to / on top of the existing plot window. (#60 @grantmcdermott)\nSupport for one-sided formulas, e.g. plot2(~ Temp | Month, airquality). (#62 @grantmcdermott and @zeileis)\nSupport for plot2(x, type = \"density\") as an alternative to plot2(density(x)). Works for both the atomic and one-sided formula methods. (#66 @grantmcdermott)\nSupport for “area” type plots as a special case of ribbon plots. (#68 @grantmcdermott)\nPartial matching for palette keywords. (#74 @grantmcdermott)\nplot2 gains a new facet argument for drawing faceted plots. Users can override the default square arrangement by passing the desired number of facet rows or columns to the companion facet.args helper function. Facets can be combined with by grouping, or used on their own. (#83, #91, #94, #96, #101, #103 @grantmcdermott)\nUsers can now control plot2-specific graphical parameters globally via the new par2() function (which is modeled on the base par() function). At the moment only a subset of global parameters, mostly related to legend and facet behaviour, are exposed in par2. But users can expect that more will be added in future releases. (#33, #94 @grantmcdermott)\n\nBug fixes:\n\nY-label correctly prints if a function was used for the atomic plot method, e.g. plot2(rnorm(100). (#52 etiennebacher)\nRibbon plot types are now automatically ordered by the x variable. (#54 @grantmcdermott)\nInterval plots like ribbons, errorbars, and pointranges are now correctly plotted even if a y variable isn’t specified. (#54 @grantmcdermott)\nCorrectly label date-time axes. (#77 @grantmcdermott and @zeileis)\nImproved consistency of legend and facet margins across different plot types and placement, via the new lmar and fmar arguments of par2(). The default legend margin is par2(lmar = c(1,0, 0.1), which means that there is 1.0 line of padding between the legend and the plot region (inside margin) and 0.1 line of padding between the legend and edge of the graphics device (outer margin). Similarly, the default facet padding is par2(fmar = c(1,1,1,1), which means that there is a single line of padding around each side of the individual facets. Users can override these defaults by passing numeric vectors of the appropriate length to par2(). For example, par2(lmar = c(0,0.1) would shrink the inner gap between the legend and plot region to zero, but leave the small outer gap to outside of the graphics device unchanged. (#94 @grantmcdermott)\nFix bug where grid wasn’t auto-expanding correctly for area plots. (#92 @grantmcdermott)",

    "text": "A lightweight extension of the base R graphics system, with support for automatic grouping, legends, facets, themes, and various other enhancements.\nThe stable version of tinyplot is available on CRAN.\ninstall.packages(\"tinyplot\")\nOr, you can grab the latest development version from R-universe.\ninstall.packages(\"tinyplot\", repos = \"https://grantmcdermott.r-universe.dev\")\n\n\n\nR users are spoiled for choice when it comes to visualization frameworks. The options, of course, include ggplot2 and lattice; say nothing of the bewildering array of extensions built around, on top of, and in between these amazing packages.1\nGiven the wealth of options, it is perhaps understandable that even avid R users can overlook the base R graphics system. This is unfortunate, because base R offers very powerful and flexible plotting facilities.2 The downside of this power and flexibility is that base R plotting can require a lot of manual tinkering. A case in point is plotting grouped data with an appropriate legend. Doing so with the generic plot() function can require several function calls or a loop, fiddling with your plot regions, and then generating the legend manually.\nThe tinyplot package aims to remove this overhead. It provides a lightweight extension of the base R graphics system that preserves the same core logic and syntax, but with numerous convenience features to make base R plotting a more user-friendly experience. For example, the core tinyplot() function—or its shorthand alias plt()—makes it easy to plot grouped datasets and generate automatic legends in a single function call. Or, you can display groups in separate facets without having to worry about manually setting plot regions. While tinyplot offers these and various other enhancements, it tries as far as possible to be a drop-in replacement for the equivalent base plotting function. Users should generally be able to swap out a valid plot() call for tinyplot()/plt() without any changes to the expected output.\nIt is worth emphasizing that tinyplot requires only base R. It has zero recursive dependencies and we have been careful to keep its installation size down to a minimum. tinyplot should thus provide an attractive and lightweight option for package developers (or regular R users!) who would like to produce convenient and sophisticated plots, combined with a minimal footprint.\n\n\n\nThe tinyplot website includes a detailed introductory tutorial, with numerous examples. But here are some quickstart examples of the package in action.\n\nlibrary(tinyplot)\n\nGrouped scatterplot with automatic legend:\n\n# with(iris, tinyplot(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length, by = Species)) # atomic\ntinyplot(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length | Species, data = iris)             # formula\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you would prefer to save on a few keystrokes, you can use the shorthand plt() alias instead instead of typing out tinyplot() in full. Here’s the same plot with this shorthand alias, plus a few aesthetic tweaks:\n\nplt(\n  Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length | Species, \n  data = iris,\n  palette = \"dark\", pch = 16,\n  grid = TRUE, frame = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking of aesthetic tweaks, tinyplot also provides a set of built-in themes for convenient plot customization:\n\ntinytheme(\"clean2\")\n\nplt(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length | Species, data = iris)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThemes are persistent and will be applied to subsequent plots.

    "text": "R users are spoiled for choice when it comes to visualization frameworks. The options, of course, include ggplot2 and lattice; say nothing of the bewildering array of extensions built around, on top of, and in between these amazing packages.1\nGiven the wealth of options, it is perhaps understandable that even avid R users can overlook the base R graphics system. This is unfortunate, because base R offers very powerful and flexible plotting facilities.2 The downside of this power and flexibility is that base R plotting can require a lot of manual tinkering. A case in point is plotting grouped data with an appropriate legend. Doing so with the generic plot() function can require several function calls or a loop, fiddling with your plot regions, and then generating the legend manually.\nThe tinyplot package aims to remove this overhead. It provides a lightweight extension of the base R graphics system that preserves the same core logic and syntax, but with numerous convenience features to make base R plotting a more user-friendly experience. For example, the core tinyplot() function—or its shorthand alias plt()—makes it easy to plot grouped datasets and generate automatic legends in a single function call. Or, you can display groups in separate facets without having to worry about manually setting plot regions. While tinyplot offers these and various other enhancements, it tries as far as possible to be a drop-in replacement for the equivalent base plotting function. Users should generally be able to swap out a valid plot() call for tinyplot()/plt() without any changes to the expected output.\nIt is worth emphasizing that tinyplot requires only base R. It has zero recursive dependencies and we have been careful to keep its installation size down to a minimum. tinyplot should thus provide an attractive and lightweight option for package developers (or regular R users!) who would like to produce convenient and sophisticated plots, combined with a minimal footprint.",

Some people like the default minimalist look of base R plots and/or are happy to customize the (many) graphical parameters that are available to them. Others find base R plots ugly and don’t want to spend time endlessly tweaking different parameters. Similarly, the inherent “canvas” approach to drawing base R graphics, with fixed placement for plot elements, means that plots don’t adjust dynamically and this can lead to awkward whitespace artifacts unless the user explicitly accounts for them.\nRegardless of where you stand in this debate, the tinyplot view is that base R graphics should ideally combine flexibility and ease of use with aesthetically pleasing end results.

Behind the scenes, this works by simultaneously setting a group of graphical parameters to achieve a particular aesthetic.

For example, when long horizontal y-axis labels are detected:\n\ntinyplot(\n  I(Sepal.Width*1e5) ~ Sepal.Length | Species,\n  facet = \"by\",\n  data = iris,\n  main = \"Title of the plot\",\n  sub = \"The left-margin adjusts to accomodate the long y-axis labels\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you may have noticed, the changes made by tinytheme() are persistent, and apply to all subsequent tinyplot() calls.\n\ntinyplot(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars, main = \"Fuel efficiency vs. horsepower\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reset graphical parameters to factory defaults, call tinytheme() without arguments.\n\ntinytheme()\ntinyplot(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars, main = \"Fuel efficiency vs. horsepower\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGallery\nWe’ll use the following running example to demonstrate the full gallery of built-in tintheme() themes.\n\np = function() {\n  tinyplot(\n    Sepal.Width ~ Sepal.Length | Species,\n    facet = \"by\",\n    data = iris,\n    main = \"Title of the plot\",\n    sub = \"A smaller subtitle\"\n  )\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“default”\n\ntinytheme() ## same as tinytheme(\"default\")\np()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“basic”\n\ntinytheme(\"basic\")\np()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“clean”\n\ntinytheme(\"clean\")\np()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“clean2”\n\ntinytheme(\"clean2\")\np()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“classic”\n\ntinytheme(\"classic\")\np()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“bw”\n\ntinytheme(\"bw\")\np()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“minimal”\n\ntinytheme(\"minimal\")\np()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“ipsum”\n\ntinytheme(\"ipsum\")\np()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“dark”\n\ntinytheme(\"dark\")\np()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“tufte”\n\ntinytheme(\"tufte\")\np()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“void”\n\ntinytheme(\"void\")\np()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“ridge”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe specialized \"ridge\" and \"ridge2\" themes are only intended for use with ridge plot types.\n\n\n\np2 = function() {\n  tinyplot(\n    Species ~ Sepal.Width | Species, legend = FALSE,\n    data = iris,\n    type = \"ridge\",\n    main = \"Title of the plot\",\n    sub = \"A smaller subtitle\"\n  )\n}\n\ntinytheme(\"ridge\")\np2()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“ridge2”\n\ntinytheme(\"ridge2\")\np2()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Reset to default theme\ntinytheme()\n\nPlease feel free to make suggestions about themes, or contribute new themes by opening a Pull Request on Github.\n\n\n\nCustom themes\nTweaking existing themes is easy.

While it is perhaps underappreciated, base R actually ships with built-in support for quite a few font families. In the code chunk above we used a member of the Hershey font family that comes bundled with the base R distribution (see ?Hershey). But this built-in support also extends to other popular LaTex and PDF fonts like “Palatino”, “ComputerModern”, “Helvetica”, “AvantGarde”, etc. (see ?pdfFonts).\nFor access to a much wider variety of fonts, you might consider the excellent showtext package (link). This package allows you to install any font family from the Google Font catalog, either on-the-fly or downloaded to your permanent fontbook collection. It plays very nicely with tinyplot.\n\n\nSimilarly, to create your own themes “from scratch”, set the theme to \"default\" and pass additional graphical parameters to tinytheme().\n\ntinytheme(\"default\", font.main = 3, col = \"red\")\np()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Reset to default theme\ntinytheme()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo see the full list of parameters that defines a particular theme, simply assign them to an object. This can be helpful if you want to explore creating your own custom theme, or tweak an existing theme.\n\n# parms = tinytheme(\"clean\")   # assigns the theme at the same time\nparms = tinyplot:::theme_clean # doesn't assign the theme\n\n# show the list of parameters used in the \"clean\" theme\nparms",

    "text": "Manual customization with tpar()\nSubtitle: And comparison with par()\nThemes are a powerful and convenient way to customize your plots. But they are not the only game in town. As any base R plotter would tell you, another way to customize your plots by setting global graphics parameters via par(). If you prefer this approach, then the good news is that it is fully compatable with tinyplot.1 However, we recommend that you rather use tpar(), which is an extended version of par() that supports all of the latter’s parameters plus some tinyplot-specific upgrades.\nHere is a quick example, where we impose several global changes (e.g., change the font family, use Tufte-style floating axes with a background panel grid, rotate tick labels, etc.) before drawing the plot.\n\nop = tpar(\n  bty    = \"n\",           # No box (frame) around the plot \n  family = \"HersheySans\", # Use R's Hershey font instead of Arial default\n  grid   = TRUE,          # Add a background grid\n  las    = 1,             # Horizontal axis tick labels\n  pch    = 19             # Larger filled points as default\n)\n\ntinyplot(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length | Species, data = iris, alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# optional: reset to the original parameter settings\ntpar(op)\n\nAgain, this approach should feel very familiar to experience base R plotters. But we will drive home the point by exploring one final difference between vanilla par() and the enhanced tpar() equivalent…\nThe graphical parameters set by par() stay in force as long as a graphical device stays open. On the other hand, these parameters are reset when the plotting window is closed or, for example, when executing a new code chunk in a Quarto notebook.2\n\npar(col = \"red\", pch = 4)\ntinyplot(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntinyplot(wt ~ qsec, data = mtcars)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, graphical parameters set by tpar() can persist across devices and Quarto code chunks thanks to a built-in “hook” mechanism (see ?setHook). To enable this persistence, we must invoke the hook=TRUE argument.\n\ntpar(col = \"red\", pch = 4, hook = TRUE)\ntinyplot(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntinyplot(wt ~ qsec, data = mtcars)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# reset defaults\ntinytheme()\n\n(Fun fact: Behind the scenes, tinytheme(&lt;theme_name&gt;) is simply passing a list of parameters to tpar(..., hook = TRUE).)",
