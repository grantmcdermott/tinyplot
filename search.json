Any reasonable way of defining the coordinates is acceptable; most likely the names of existing vectors or columns of data frames. See the ‘Examples’ section below, or the function xy.coords for details. If supplied separately, x and y must be of the same length.\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n\nother graphical parameters. See par or the \"Details\" section of plot.\n\n\n\n\nby\n\n\ngrouping variable(s). The default behaviour is for groups to be represented in the form of distinct colours, which will also trigger an automatic legend. (See legend below for customization options.) However, groups can also be presented through other plot parameters (e.g., pch or lty) by passing an appropriate \"by\" keyword; see Examples. Note that continuous (i.e., gradient) colour legends are also supported if the user passes a numeric or integer to by.\n\n\n\n\nfacet\n\n\nthe faceting variable(s) that you want arrange separate plot windows by. Can be specified in various ways:\n\n\nIn \"atomic\" form, e.g. facet = fvar. To facet by multiple variables in atomic form, simply interact them, e.g. interaction(fvar1, fvar2) or factor(fvar1):factor(fvar2).\n\n\nAs a one-sided formula, e.g. facet = ~fvar. Multiple variables can be specified in the formula RHS, e.g. ~fvar1 + fvar2 or ~fvar1:fvar2. Note that these multi-variable cases are all treated equivalently and converted to interaction(fvar1, fvar2, …) internally. (No distinction is made between different types of binary operators, for example, and so f1+f2 is treated the same as f1:f2, is treated the same as f1*f2, etc.)\n\n\nAs a two-side formula, e.g. facet = fvar1 ~ fvar2. In this case, the facet windows are arranged in a fixed grid layout, with the formula LHS defining the facet rows and the RHS defining the facet columns. At present only single variables on each side of the formula are well supported. (We don’t recommend trying to use multiple variables on either the LHS or RHS of the two-sided formula case.)\n\n\nAs a special “by” convenience keyword, in which case facets will match the grouping variable(s) passed to by above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfacet.args\n\n\nan optional list of arguments for controlling faceting behaviour. (Ignored if facet is NULL.) Supported arguments are as follows:\n\n\nnrow, ncol for overriding the default \"square\" facet window arrangement. Only one of these should be specified, but nrow will take precedence if both are specified together. Ignored if a two-sided formula is passed to the main facet argument, since the layout is arranged in a fixed grid.\n\n\nfmar a vector of form c(b,l,t,r) for controlling the base margin between facets in terms of lines. Defaults to the value of tpar(“fmar”), which should be c(1,1,1,1), i.e. a single line of padding around each individual facet, assuming it hasn’t been overridden by the user as part their global tpar settings. Note some automatic adjustments are made for certain layouts, and depending on whether the plot is framed or not, to reduce excess whitespace. See tpar for more details.\n\n\ncex, font, col, bg, border for adjusting the facet title text and background. Default values for these arguments are inherited from tpar (where they take a \"facet.\" prefix, e.g. tpar(“facet.cex”)). The latter function can also be used to set these features globally for all tinyplot plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata\n\n\na data.frame (or list) from which the variables in formula should be taken. A matrix is converted to a data frame.\n\n\n\n\ntype\n\n\ncharacter string giving the type of plot desired. Options are:\n\n\nThe same set of 1-character values supported by plot: \"p\" for points, \"l\" for lines, \"b\" for both points and lines, \"c\" for empty points joined by lines, \"o\" for overplotted points and lines, \"s\" and \"S\" for stair steps and \"h\" for histogram-like vertical lines. \"n\" does not produce any points or lines.\n\n\nAdditional tinyplot types: \"density\" for densities, \"polygon\" for polygons, \"pointrange\" or \"errorbar\" for segment intervals, and \"polygon\", \"ribbon\" or \"area\" for polygon intervals (where area plots are a special case of ribbon plots with ymin set to 0 and ymax set to y; see below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nxlim\n\n\nthe x limits (x1, x2) of the plot. Note that x1 &gt; x2 is allowed and leads to a ‘reversed axis’. The default value, NULL, indicates that the range of the finite values to be plotted should be used.\n\n\n\n\nylim\n\n\nthe y limits of the plot.\n\n\n\n\nlog\n\n\na character string which contains \"x\" if the x axis is to be logarithmic, \"y\" if the y axis is to be logarithmic and \"xy\" or \"yx\" if both axes are to be logarithmic.\n\n\n\n\nmain\n\n\na main title for the plot, see also title.\n\n\n\n\nsub\n\n\na subtitle for the plot.\n\n\n\n\nxlab\n\n\na label for the x axis, defaults to a description of x.\n\n\n\n\nylab\n\n\na label for the y axis, defaults to a description of y.\n\n\n\n\nann\n\n\na logical value indicating whether the default annotation (title and x and y axis labels) should appear on the plot.\n\n\n\n\naxes\n\n\na logical value indicating whether both axes should be drawn on the plot. Use graphical parameter \"xaxt\" or \"yaxt\" to suppress just one of the axes.\n\n\n\n\nframe.plot\n\n\na logical indicating whether a box should be drawn around the plot. Can also use frame as an acceptable argument alias.\n\n\n\n\nasp\n\n\nthe y/xy/x aspect ratio, see plot.window.\n\n\n\n\ngrid\n\n\nargument for plotting a background panel grid, one of either:\n\n\na logical (i.e., TRUE to draw the grid), or\n\n\na panel grid plotting function like grid(). Note that this argument replaces the panel.first and panel.last arguments from base plot() and tries to make the process more seamless with better default behaviour. The default behaviour is determined by (and can be set globally through) the value of tpar(“grid”).\n\n\n\n\n\n\npalette\n\n\none of the following options:\n\n\nNULL (default), in which case the palette will be chosen according to the class and cardinality of the \"by\" grouping variable. For non-ordered factors or strings with a reasonable number of groups, this will inherit directly from the user’s default palette (e.g., \"R4\"). In other cases, including ordered factors and high cardinality, the \"Viridis\" palette will be used instead. Note that a slightly restricted version of the \"Viridis\" palette—where extreme color values have been trimmed to improve visual perception—will be used for ordered factors and continuous variables. In the latter case of a continuous grouping variable, we also generate a gradient legend swatch.\n\n\nA convenience string corresponding to one of the many palettes listed by either palette.pals() or hcl.pals(). Note that the string can be case-insensitive (e.g., \"Okabe-Ito\" and \"okabe-ito\" are both valid).\n\n\nA palette-generating function. This can be \"bare\" (e.g., palette.colors) or \"closed\" with a set of named arguments (e.g., palette.colors(palette = “Okabe-Ito”, alpha = 0.5)). Note that any unnamed arguments will be ignored and the key n argument, denoting the number of colours, will automatically be spliced in as the number of groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlegend\n\n\none of the following options:\n\n\nNULL (default), in which case the legend will be determined by the grouping variable. If there is no group variable (i.e., by is NULL) then no legend is drawn. If a grouping variable is detected, then an automatic legend is drawn to the outer right of the plotting area. Note that the legend title and categories will automatically be inferred from the by argument and underlying data.\n\n\nA convenience string indicating the legend position. The string should correspond to one of the position keywords supported by the base legend function, e.g. \"right\", \"topleft\", \"bottom\", etc. In addition, tinyplot supports adding a trailing exclamation point to these keywords, e.g. \"right!\", \"topleft!\", or \"bottom!\". This will place the legend outside the plotting area and adjust the margins of the plot accordingly. Finally, users can also turn off any legend printing by specifying \"none\".\n\n\nLogical value, where TRUE corresponds to the default case above (same effect as specifying NULL) and FALSE turns the legend off (same effect as specifying \"none\").\n\n\nA list or, equivalently, a dedicated legend() function with supported legend arguments, e.g. \"bty\", \"horiz\", and so forth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npch\n\n\nplotting \"character\", i.e., symbol to use. Character, integer, or vector of length equal to the number of categories in the by variable. See pch. In addition, users can supply a special pch = “by” convenience argument, in which case the characters will automatically loop over the number groups. This automatic looping will begin at the global character value (i.e., par(“pch”)) and recycle as necessary.\n\n\n\n\nlty\n\n\nline type. Character, integer, or vector of length equal to the number of categories in the by variable. See lty. In addition, users can supply a special lty = “by” convenience argument, in which case the line type will automatically loop over the number groups. This automatic looping will begin at the global line type value (i.e., par(“lty”)) and recycle as necessary.\n\n\n\n\nlwd\n\n\nline width. Numeric scalar or vector of length equal to the number of categories in the by variable. See lwd. In addition, users can supply a special lwd = “by” convenience argument, in which case the line width will automatically loop over the number of groups. This automatic looping will be centered at the global line width value (i.e.,\n\n\n\n\ncol\n\n\nplotting color. Character, integer, or vector of length equal to the number of categories in the by variable. See col. Note that the default behaviour in tinyplot is to vary group colors along any variables declared in the by argument. Thus, specifying colors manually should not be necessary unless users wish to override the automatic colors produced by this grouping process. Typically, this would only be done if grouping features are deferred to some other graphical parameter (i.e., passing the \"by\" keyword to one of pch, lty, lwd, or bg; see below.)\n\n\n\n\nbg\n\n\nbackground fill color for the open plot symbols 21:25 (see points.default), as well as ribbon and area plot types. For the latter group—including filled density plots—an automatic alpha transparency adjustment will be applied (see the ribbon_alpha argument further below). Users can also supply a special bg = “by” convenience argument, in which case the background fill will inherit the automatic group coloring intended for the col argument. Note that this grouped inheritance will persist even if the col defaults are themselves overridden. For example, tinyplot(y ~ x | z, data = fakedata, pch = 22, col = “blue”, bg = “by”) will yield filled squares with a blue border.\n\n\n\n\nfill\n\n\nalias for bg. If non-NULL values for both bg and fill are provided, then the latter will be ignored in favour of the former.\n\n\n\n\ncex\n\n\ncharacter expansion. A numerical vector (can be a single value) giving the amount by which plotting characters and symbols should be scaled relative to the default. Note that NULL is equivalent to 1.0, while NA renders the characters invisible.\n\n\n\n\npar_restore\n\n\na logical value indicating whether the par settings prior to calling tinyplot should be restored on exit. Defaults to FALSE, which makes it possible to add elements to the plot after it has been drawn. However, note the the outer margins of the graphics device may have been altered to make space for the tinyplot legend. Users can opt out of this persistent behaviour by setting to TRUE instead. (Another option would be calling dev.off() to reset all par settings to their defaults.)\n\n\n\n\nymin, ymax\n\n\nminimum and maximum coordinates of interval plot types. Only used when the type argument is one of \"pointrange\", \"errorbar\", or \"ribbon\".\n\n\n\n\nribbon_alpha\n\n\nnumeric factor modifying the opacity alpha of any ribbon shading; typically in [0, 1]. Default value is 0.2. Only used when type = “ribbon”, or when the bg fill argument is specified in a density plot (since filled density plots are converted to ribbon plots internally).\n\n\n\n\nadd\n\n\nlogical. If TRUE, then elements are added to the current plot rather than drawing a new plot window. Note that the automatic legend for the added elements will be turned off.\n\n\n\n\nfile\n\n\ncharacter string giving the file path for writing a plot to disk. If specified, the plot will not be displayed interactively, but rather sent to the appropriate external graphics device (i.e., png, jpeg, pdf, or svg). As a point of convenience, note that any global parameters held in (t)par are automatically carried over to the external device and don’t need to be reset (in contrast to the conventional base R approach that requires manually opening and closing the device). The device type is determined by the file extension at the end of the provided path, and must be one of \".png\", \".jpg\" (\".jpeg\"), \".pdf\", or \".svg\". (Other file types may be supported in the future.) The file dimensions can be controlled by the corresponding width and height arguments below, otherwise will fall back to the “file.width” and “file.height” values held in tpar (i.e., both defaulting to 7 inches, and where the default resolution for bitmap files is also specified as 300 DPI).\n\n\n\n\nwidth\n\n\nnumeric giving the plot width in inches. Together with height, typically used in conjunction with the file argument above, overriding the default values held in tpar(“file.width”, “file.height”). If either width or height is specified, but a corresponding file argument is not provided as well, then a new interactive graphics device dimensions will be opened along the given dimensions. Note that this interactive resizing may not work consistently from within an IDE like RStudio that has an integrated graphics windows.\n\n\n\n\nheight\n\n\nnumeric giving the plot height in inches. Same considerations as width (above) apply, e.g. will default to tpar(“file.height”) if not specified.\n\n\n\n\nformula\n\n\na formula that optionally includes grouping variable(s) after a vertical bar, e.g. y ~ x | z. One-sided formulae are also permitted, e.g. ~ y | z. Note that the formula and x arguments should not be specified in the same call.\n\n\n\n\nsubset, na.action, drop.unused.levels\n\n\narguments passed to model.frame when extracting the data from formula and data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisregarding the enhancements that it supports, tinyplot tries as far as possible to mimic the behaviour and syntax logic of the original base plot function. Users should therefore be able to swap out existing plot calls for tinyplot (or its shorthand alias plt), without causing unexpected changes to the output.\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tinyplot)\n\n\n# save graphics parameters to restore them later\nop = tpar()\n\n\naq = transform(\n  airquality,\n  Month = factor(Month, labels = month.abb[unique(Month)])\n)\n\n# tinyplot should be a drop-in replacement for (most) regular plot calls.

Any reasonable way of defining the coordinates is acceptable; most likely the names of existing vectors or columns of data frames. See the ‘Examples’ section below, or the function xy.coords for details. If supplied separately, x and y must be of the same length.\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n\nother graphical parameters. See par or the \"Details\" section of plot.\n\n\n\n\nby\n\n\ngrouping variable(s). The default behaviour is for groups to be represented in the form of distinct colours, which will also trigger an automatic legend. (See legend below for customization options.) However, groups can also be presented through other plot parameters (e.g., pch or lty) by passing an appropriate \"by\" keyword; see Examples. Note that continuous (i.e., gradient) colour legends are also supported if the user passes a numeric or integer to by.\n\n\n\n\nfacet\n\n\nthe faceting variable(s) that you want arrange separate plot windows by. Can be specified in various ways:\n\n\nIn \"atomic\" form, e.g. facet = fvar. To facet by multiple variables in atomic form, simply interact them, e.g. interaction(fvar1, fvar2) or factor(fvar1):factor(fvar2).\n\n\nAs a one-sided formula, e.g. facet = ~fvar. Multiple variables can be specified in the formula RHS, e.g. ~fvar1 + fvar2 or ~fvar1:fvar2. Note that these multi-variable cases are all treated equivalently and converted to interaction(fvar1, fvar2, …) internally. (No distinction is made between different types of binary operators, for example, and so f1+f2 is treated the same as f1:f2, is treated the same as f1*f2, etc.)\n\n\nAs a two-side formula, e.g. facet = fvar1 ~ fvar2. In this case, the facet windows are arranged in a fixed grid layout, with the formula LHS defining the facet rows and the RHS defining the facet columns. At present only single variables on each side of the formula are well supported. (We don’t recommend trying to use multiple variables on either the LHS or RHS of the two-sided formula case.)\n\n\nAs a special “by” convenience keyword, in which case facets will match the grouping variable(s) passed to by above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfacet.args\n\n\nan optional list of arguments for controlling faceting behaviour. (Ignored if facet is NULL.) Supported arguments are as follows:\n\n\nnrow, ncol for overriding the default \"square\" facet window arrangement. Only one of these should be specified, but nrow will take precedence if both are specified together. Ignored if a two-sided formula is passed to the main facet argument, since the layout is arranged in a fixed grid.\n\n\nfmar a vector of form c(b,l,t,r) for controlling the base margin between facets in terms of lines. Defaults to the value of tpar(“fmar”), which should be c(1,1,1,1), i.e. a single line of padding around each individual facet, assuming it hasn’t been overridden by the user as part their global tpar settings. Note some automatic adjustments are made for certain layouts, and depending on whether the plot is framed or not, to reduce excess whitespace. See tpar for more details.\n\n\ncex, font, col, bg, border for adjusting the facet title text and background. Default values for these arguments are inherited from tpar (where they take a \"facet.\" prefix, e.g. tpar(“facet.cex”)). The latter function can also be used to set these features globally for all tinyplot plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata\n\n\na data.frame (or list) from which the variables in formula should be taken. A matrix is converted to a data frame.\n\n\n\n\ntype\n\n\ncharacter string giving the type of plot desired. Options are:\n\n\nThe same set of 1-character values supported by plot: \"p\" for points, \"l\" for lines, \"b\" for both points and lines, \"c\" for empty points joined by lines, \"o\" for overplotted points and lines, \"s\" and \"S\" for stair steps and \"h\" for histogram-like vertical lines. \"n\" does not produce any points or lines.\n\n\nAdditional tinyplot types: \"density\" for densities, \"polygon\" for polygons, \"pointrange\" or \"errorbar\" for segment intervals, and \"polygon\", \"ribbon\" or \"area\" for polygon intervals (where area plots are a special case of ribbon plots with ymin set to 0 and ymax set to y; see below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nxlim\n\n\nthe x limits (x1, x2) of the plot. Note that x1 &gt; x2 is allowed and leads to a ‘reversed axis’. The default value, NULL, indicates that the range of the finite values to be plotted should be used.\n\n\n\n\nylim\n\n\nthe y limits of the plot.\n\n\n\n\nlog\n\n\na character string which contains \"x\" if the x axis is to be logarithmic, \"y\" if the y axis is to be logarithmic and \"xy\" or \"yx\" if both axes are to be logarithmic.\n\n\n\n\nmain\n\n\na main title for the plot, see also title.\n\n\n\n\nsub\n\n\na subtitle for the plot.\n\n\n\n\nxlab\n\n\na label for the x axis, defaults to a description of x.\n\n\n\n\nylab\n\n\na label for the y axis, defaults to a description of y.\n\n\n\n\nann\n\n\na logical value indicating whether the default annotation (title and x and y axis labels) should appear on the plot.\n\n\n\n\naxes\n\n\na logical value indicating whether both axes should be drawn on the plot. Use graphical parameter \"xaxt\" or \"yaxt\" to suppress just one of the axes.\n\n\n\n\nframe.plot\n\n\na logical indicating whether a box should be drawn around the plot. Can also use frame as an acceptable argument alias.\n\n\n\n\nasp\n\n\nthe y/xy/x aspect ratio, see plot.window.\n\n\n\n\ngrid\n\n\nargument for plotting a background panel grid, one of either:\n\n\na logical (i.e., TRUE to draw the grid), or\n\n\na panel grid plotting function like grid(). Note that this argument replaces the panel.first and panel.last arguments from base plot() and tries to make the process more seamless with better default behaviour. The default behaviour is determined by (and can be set globally through) the value of tpar(“grid”).\n\n\n\n\n\n\npalette\n\n\none of the following options:\n\n\nNULL (default), in which case the palette will be chosen according to the class and cardinality of the \"by\" grouping variable. For non-ordered factors or strings with a reasonable number of groups, this will inherit directly from the user’s default palette (e.g., \"R4\"). In other cases, including ordered factors and high cardinality, the \"Viridis\" palette will be used instead. Note that a slightly restricted version of the \"Viridis\" palette—where extreme color values have been trimmed to improve visual perception—will be used for ordered factors and continuous variables. In the latter case of a continuous grouping variable, we also generate a gradient legend swatch.\n\n\nA convenience string corresponding to one of the many palettes listed by either palette.pals() or hcl.pals(). Note that the string can be case-insensitive (e.g., \"Okabe-Ito\" and \"okabe-ito\" are both valid).\n\n\nA palette-generating function. This can be \"bare\" (e.g., palette.colors) or \"closed\" with a set of named arguments (e.g., palette.colors(palette = “Okabe-Ito”, alpha = 0.5)). Note that any unnamed arguments will be ignored and the key n argument, denoting the number of colours, will automatically be spliced in as the number of groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlegend\n\n\none of the following options:\n\n\nNULL (default), in which case the legend will be determined by the grouping variable. If there is no group variable (i.e., by is NULL) then no legend is drawn. If a grouping variable is detected, then an automatic legend is drawn to the outer right of the plotting area. Note that the legend title and categories will automatically be inferred from the by argument and underlying data.\n\n\nA convenience string indicating the legend position. The string should correspond to one of the position keywords supported by the base legend function, e.g. \"right\", \"topleft\", \"bottom\", etc. In addition, tinyplot supports adding a trailing exclamation point to these keywords, e.g. \"right!\", \"topleft!\", or \"bottom!\". This will place the legend outside the plotting area and adjust the margins of the plot accordingly. Finally, users can also turn off any legend printing by specifying \"none\".\n\n\nLogical value, where TRUE corresponds to the default case above (same effect as specifying NULL) and FALSE turns the legend off (same effect as specifying \"none\").\n\n\nA list or, equivalently, a dedicated legend() function with supported legend arguments, e.g. \"bty\", \"horiz\", and so forth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npch\n\n\nplotting \"character\", i.e., symbol to use. Character, integer, or vector of length equal to the number of categories in the by variable. See pch. In addition, users can supply a special pch = “by” convenience argument, in which case the characters will automatically loop over the number groups. This automatic looping will begin at the global character value (i.e., par(“pch”)) and recycle as necessary.\n\n\n\n\nlty\n\n\nline type. Character, integer, or vector of length equal to the number of categories in the by variable. See lty. In addition, users can supply a special lty = “by” convenience argument, in which case the line type will automatically loop over the number groups. This automatic looping will begin at the global line type value (i.e., par(“lty”)) and recycle as necessary.\n\n\n\n\nlwd\n\n\nline width. Numeric scalar or vector of length equal to the number of categories in the by variable. See lwd. In addition, users can supply a special lwd = “by” convenience argument, in which case the line width will automatically loop over the number of groups. This automatic looping will be centered at the global line width value (i.e.,\n\n\n\n\ncol\n\n\nplotting color. Character, integer, or vector of length equal to the number of categories in the by variable. See col. Note that the default behaviour in tinyplot is to vary group colors along any variables declared in the by argument. Thus, specifying colors manually should not be necessary unless users wish to override the automatic colors produced by this grouping process. Typically, this would only be done if grouping features are deferred to some other graphical parameter (i.e., passing the \"by\" keyword to one of pch, lty, lwd, or bg; see below.)\n\n\n\n\nbg\n\n\nbackground fill color for the open plot symbols 21:25 (see points.default), as well as ribbon and area plot types. For the latter group—including filled density plots—an automatic alpha transparency adjustment will be applied (see the ribbon_alpha argument further below). Users can also supply a special bg = “by” convenience argument, in which case the background fill will inherit the automatic group coloring intended for the col argument. Note that this grouped inheritance will persist even if the col defaults are themselves overridden. For example, tinyplot(y ~ x | z, data = fakedata, pch = 22, col = “blue”, bg = “by”) will yield filled squares with a blue border.\n\n\n\n\nfill\n\n\nalias for bg. If non-NULL values for both bg and fill are provided, then the latter will be ignored in favour of the former.\n\n\n\n\ncex\n\n\ncharacter expansion. A numerical vector (can be a single value) giving the amount by which plotting characters and symbols should be scaled relative to the default. Note that NULL is equivalent to 1.0, while NA renders the characters invisible.\n\n\n\n\npar_restore\n\n\na logical value indicating whether the par settings prior to calling tinyplot should be restored on exit. Defaults to FALSE, which makes it possible to add elements to the plot after it has been drawn. However, note the the outer margins of the graphics device may have been altered to make space for the tinyplot legend. Users can opt out of this persistent behaviour by setting to TRUE instead. (Another option would be calling dev.off() to reset all par settings to their defaults.)\n\n\n\n\nymin, ymax\n\n\nminimum and maximum coordinates of interval plot types. Only used when the type argument is one of \"pointrange\", \"errorbar\", or \"ribbon\".\n\n\n\n\nribbon_alpha\n\n\nnumeric factor modifying the opacity alpha of any ribbon shading; typically in [0, 1]. Default value is 0.2. Only used when type = “ribbon”, or when the bg fill argument is specified in a density plot (since filled density plots are converted to ribbon plots internally).\n\n\n\n\nadd\n\n\nlogical. If TRUE, then elements are added to the current plot rather than drawing a new plot window. Note that the automatic legend for the added elements will be turned off.\n\n\n\n\nfile\n\n\ncharacter string giving the file path for writing a plot to disk. If specified, the plot will not be displayed interactively, but rather sent to the appropriate external graphics device (i.e., png, jpeg, pdf, or svg). As a point of convenience, note that any global parameters held in (t)par are automatically carried over to the external device and don’t need to be reset (in contrast to the conventional base R approach that requires manually opening and closing the device). The device type is determined by the file extension at the end of the provided path, and must be one of \".png\", \".jpg\" (\".jpeg\"), \".pdf\", or \".svg\". (Other file types may be supported in the future.) The file dimensions can be controlled by the corresponding width and height arguments below, otherwise will fall back to the “file.width” and “file.height” values held in tpar (i.e., both defaulting to 7 inches, and where the default resolution for bitmap files is also specified as 300 DPI).\n\n\n\n\nwidth\n\n\nnumeric giving the plot width in inches. Together with height, typically used in conjunction with the file argument above, overriding the default values held in tpar(“file.width”, “file.height”). If either width or height is specified, but a corresponding file argument is not provided as well, then a new interactive graphics device dimensions will be opened along the given dimensions. Note that this interactive resizing may not work consistently from within an IDE like RStudio that has an integrated graphics windows.\n\n\n\n\nheight\n\n\nnumeric giving the plot height in inches. Same considerations as width (above) apply, e.g. will default to tpar(“file.height”) if not specified.\n\n\n\n\nformula\n\n\na formula that optionally includes grouping variable(s) after a vertical bar, e.g. y ~ x | z. One-sided formulae are also permitted, e.g. ~ y | z. Note that the formula and x arguments should not be specified in the same call.\n\n\n\n\nsubset, na.action, drop.unused.levels\n\n\narguments passed to model.frame when extracting the data from formula and data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisregarding the enhancements that it supports, tinyplot tries as far as possible to mimic the behaviour and syntax logic of the original base plot function. Users should therefore be able to swap out existing plot calls for tinyplot (or its shorthand alias plt), without causing unexpected changes to the output.\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tinyplot)\n\n\n# save graphics parameters to restore them later\nop = tpar()\n\n\naq = transform(\n  airquality,\n  Month = factor(Month, labels = month.abb[unique(Month)])\n)\n\n# tinyplot should be a drop-in replacement for (most) regular plot calls.

    "text": "tpar extends par, serving as a drop-in replacement for setting or querying graphical parameters. The key difference is that, beyond supporting the standard group of R graphical parameters, tpar also supports additional graphical parameters that are provided by tinyplot. Similar to par, parameters are set by passing appropriate key = value argument pairs, and multiple parameters can be set or queried at the same time.\n\n\n\ntpar(...)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n\narguments of the form key = value. This includes all of the parameters typically supported by par, as well as the tinyplot-specific ones described in the ‘Graphical Parameters’ section below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tinyplot-specfic parameters are saved in an internal environment called .tpar for performance and safety reasons. However, they can also be set at package load time via options, which may prove convenient for users that want to enable different default behaviour at startup (e.g., through an .Rprofile file). These options all take a tinyplot_* prefix, e.g. options(tinyplot_grid = TRUE, tinyplot_facet.bg = “grey90”).\nFor their part, any \"base\" graphical parameters are caught dynamically and passed on to par as appropriate. Technically, only parameters that satisify par(…, no.readonly = TRUE) are evaluated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfacet.cex\n\n\n\n\nExpansion factor for facet titles.

Just place the “by” grouping variable after a vertical bar (i.e., |).\n\ntinyplot(Temp ~ Day | Month, data = aq)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use standard base plotting arguments to adjust features of your plot. For example, change pch (plot character) to get filled points.\n\ntinyplot(\n  Temp ~ Day | Month, data = aq,\n  pch = 16\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, converting to a grouped line plot is a simple matter of adjusting the type argument.\n\ntinyplot(\n  Temp ~ Day | Month, data = aq,\n  type = \"l\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default behaviour of tinyplot is to represent groups through colour. However, note that we can automatically adjust pch and lty by groups too by passing the \"by\" convenience keyword. This can be used in conjunction with the default group colouring. Or, as a replacement for group colouring—an option that may be particularly useful for contexts where colour is expensive or prohibited (e.g., certain academic journals).\n\ntinyplot(\n  Temp ~ Day | Month, data = aq,\n  type = \"l\",\n  col = \"black\", # override automatic group colours\n  lty = \"by\"     # change line type by group instead\n)",

The default set of discrete colours are inherited from the user’s current global palette. (Most likely the “R4” set of colors; see ?palette). However, all of the various palettes listed by palette.pals() and hcl.pals() are supported as convenience strings.2 Note that case-insensitive, partial matching for these convenience string is allowed.

We’ll see a demonstration of this further below.\nTo underscore what we said earlier, colours are inherited from the user’s current palette. So these can also be set globally, just as they can for the base plot function.

    "text": "Legend\nIn all of the preceding plots, you will have noticed that we get an automatic legend. The legend position and look can be customized with the legend argument. At a minimum, you can pass the familiar legend position keywords as a convenience string (“topright”, “bottom”, “left”, etc.). Moreover, a key feature of tinyplot is that we can easily and elegantly place the legend outside the plot area by adding a trailing “!” to these keywords. (As you may have realised, the default legend position is “right!”.) Let’s demonstrate by moving the legend to the left of the plot:\n\ntinyplot(\n  Temp ~ Day | Month, data = aq,\n  type = \"l\",\n  legend = \"left!\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond the convenience of these positional keywords, the legend argument also permits additional customization by passing an appropriate function (or, a list of arguments that will be passed on to the standard legend() function internally.) So you can change or turn off the legend title, remove the bounding box, switch the direction of the legend text to horizontal, etc. Here’s a grouped density plot example, where we also add some shading by specifying that the background colour should vary by groups too.\n\nwith(\n  aq,\n  tinyplot(\n    density(Temp),\n    by = Month,\n    fill = \"by\",                         # add fill by groups\n    grid = TRUE,                         # add background grid\n    legend = list(\"topright\", bty = \"o\") # change legend features\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, note that gradient legends are also supported for continuous grouping variables. Gradient legends can be customized in a similar vein to the discrete legends that we have seen so far (keyword positioning, palette choice, alpha transparency, etc.) But here is a simple example that demonstrates the default behaviour.\n\ntinyplot(Temp ~ Wind | Ozone, data = aq, pch = 19)",

    "text": "Facets\nAlongside the standard “by” grouping approach that we have seen thus far, tinyplot also supports faceted plots. Mirroring the main tinyplot function, the facet argument accepts both atomic and formula methods.\n\nwith(\n  aq,\n  tinyplot(\n    x = Day, y = fit,\n    ymin = lwr, ymax = upr,\n    type = \"ribbon\",\n    facet = Month, ## &lt;= facet, not by\n    grid = TRUE,\n    main = \"Predicted air temperatures\"\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, facets will be arranged in a square configuration if more than three facets are detected. Users can override this behaviour by supplying nrow or ncol in the “facet.args” helper function. (The margin padding between individual facets can also be adjusted via the fmar argument.) Note that we can also reduce axis label redundancy by turning off the plot frame.\n\nwith(\n  aq,\n  tinyplot(\n    x = Day, y = fit,\n    ymin = lwr, ymax = upr,\n    type = \"ribbon\",\n    facet = Month,\n    facet.args = list(nrow = 1),\n    grid = TRUE, frame = FALSE,\n    main = \"Predicted air temperatures\"\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a slightly fancier version where we combine facets with (by) colour grouping, add a background fill to the facet text, and also add back the original values to our model predictions. For this particular example, we’ll use the facet = \"by\" convenience shorthand to facet along the same month variable as the colour grouping. But you can easily specify different by and facet variables if that’s what your data support.\n\n# Plot the original points \nwith(\n  aq,\n  tinyplot(\n    x = Day, y = Temp,\n    by = Month,\n    facet = \"by\", facet.args = list(bg = \"grey90\"),\n    palette = \"dark2\",\n    grid = TRUE, frame = FALSE, ylim = c(50, 100),\n    main = \"Actual and predicted air temperatures\"\n  )\n)\n# Add the model predictions to the same plot \nwith(\n  aq,\n  tinyplot(\n    x = Day, y = fit,\n    ymin = lwr, ymax = upr,\n    by = Month, facet = \"by\",\n    type = \"ribbon\",\n    palette = \"dark2\",\n    add = TRUE\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, the facet argument also accepts a formula interface. One particular use case is for two-sided formulas, which arranges the facet layout in a fixed grid arrangement. Here’s a simple (if contrived) example.\n\naq$hot = ifelse(aq$Temp&gt;=75, \"hot\", \"cold\")\naq$windy = ifelse(aq$Wind&gt;=15, \"windy\", \"calm\")\n\ntinyplot(\n Temp ~ Day, data = aq,\n facet = windy ~ hot,\n # the rest of these arguments are optional...\n facet.args = list(col = \"white\", bg = \"black\"),\n pch = 16, col = \"dodgerblue\",\n grid = TRUE, frame = FALSE, ylim = c(50, 100),\n main = \"Daily temperatures vs. wind\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe facet.args customizations can also be set globally via the tpar() function, which provides a nice segue to our final section.",

    "text": "Customization\nCustomizing your plots further is straightforward, whether that is done directly by changing tinyplot arguments for a single plot, or by setting global parameters. For setting global parameters, users can invoke the standard par() arguments. But for improved convenience and integration with the rest of the package, we recommend that users instead go via tpar(), which is an extended version of par() that supports all of the latter’s parameters plus some tinyplot-specific ones. Here’s a quick penultimate example, where we impose several global changes (e.g., rotated axis labels, removed plot frame to get Tufte-style floating axes, etc.) before drawing the plot. change our point character, tick labels, and font family globally, before adding some transparency to our colour palette, and use Tufte-style floating axes with a background panel grid.\n\nop = tpar(\n  bty    = \"n\",           # No box (frame) around the plot \n  family = \"HersheySans\", # Use R's Hershey font instead of Arial default\n  grid   = TRUE,          # Add a background grid\n  las    = 1,             # Horizontal axis tick labels\n  pch    = 16             # Filled points as default\n)\n\ntinyplot(\n  Temp ~ Day | Month, data = aq,\n  type = \"b\",\n  palette = palette.colors(palette = \"tableau\", alpha = 0.5),\n  main = \"Daily temperatures by month\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(For access to a wider array of fonts, you might consider the showtext package (link).)\nAt the risk of repeating ourselves, the use of (t)par in the previous example again underscores the correspondence with the base graphics system. Because tinyplot is effectively a convenience wrapper around base plot, any global elements that you have set for the latter should carry over to the former. For nice out-of-the-box themes, we recommend the basetheme package (link).\n\ntpar(op) # revert global changes from above\n\nlibrary(basetheme)\nbasetheme(\"royal\") # or \"clean\", \"dark\", \"ink\", \"brutal\", etc.\n\ntpar(pch = 15) # filled squares as first pch type\n\ntinyplot(\n  Temp ~ Day | Month, data = aq,\n  type = \"b\",\n  pch = \"by\",\n  palette = \"tropic\",\n  main = \"Daily temperatures by month\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbasetheme(NULL)  # back to default theme\ndev.off()\n#&gt; null device \n#&gt;           1",

This is true, but there are several limitations. First, you don’t get an automatic legend. Second, the base plot.formula method doesn’t specify the grouping within the formula itself (not a deal-breaker, but not particularly consistent either). Third, and perhaps most importantly, this grouping doesn’t carry over to line plots (i.e., type=“l”). Instead, you have to transpose your data and use matplot.

    "text": "License:\n\nFormally switch to Apache 2.0 license. (#141 @grantmcdermott)\n\nNew features:\n\nGradient legends are now supported if a continuous variable is passed to by. Thanks to @zeileis for detailed feedback and advice around the default palette choice (a restricted version of the “viridis” palette), as well as StackOverflow user mnel, whose answer here provided the inspiration for the final implementation. (#122 @grantmcdermott)\nOrdered factors now inherit a discrete sequential color palette (“viridis”) by default. Thanks to @zeileis for the suggestion. (#130 @grantmcdermott)\nSupport user-supplied polygons. (#127 @grantmcdermott)\nSupport for the lwd argument for adjusting line widths. Similar to pch, lty, etc. this arguments also accepts a “by” convenience keyword to automatically vary line widths by group. (#134 @grantmcdermott)\ntpar() now accepts standard par() arguments in addition to the tinyplot-specific ones. This allows users to set or query graphical parameters via a single convenience function, instead having to invoke tpar and par separately.\nUsers can write plots directly to disk using the new file argument, alongside corresponding width and height arguments for output customization (both of which are defined in inches). For example, tinyplot(..., file = \"~/myplot.png\", width = 8, height = 5). This implementation relies on a simple internal wrapper around the traditional R external graphics devices like png(), pdf(), etc. But it may prove more convenient, since the current global graphics parameters held in (t)par() are carried over to the external device too and don’t need to be reset. Note that the appropriate device type is determined automatically by the file extension, which must be one of “.png”, “.jpg” (“.jpeg”), “.pdf”, or “.svg”. (#143 @grantmcdermott)\n\nBug fixes:\n\nFixed bug that prevented tpar(facet.x = ...) args from being passed forward and set correctly. (#137 @grantmcdermott)\n\nInternals:\n\nWe no longer ship the vignette(s) with the built package. This helps to reduce the size of the installation tarball and also avoids some redundancy with the actual help documentation (since many of the examples are the same). Note that the vignettes are all still rendered and available online at the tinyplot website. (#135 @grantmcdermott)\nSimilarly, we anticipate skipping tests on CRAN since the large suite of test snapshots (images) held in inst/tinytest is pushing the install tarball over CRAN’s recommended 5 MB limit. Please note that local testing of the package requires adding the NOT_CRAN=TRUE environment variable to your .Renviron file (or, exporting it in your .bashrc/.zshrc/etc. dotfile if you prefer that approach). (#145 @vincentarelbundock & @grantmcdermott)\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT BREAKING CHANGE:\nThe package has been renamed to tinyplot. (#22 @grantmcdermott)\nThis package renaming also incorporates the following function changes:\n\nplot2() is replaced by tinyplot() (or its shorthand alias plt()).\npar2() is replaced by tpar().\n\nSo, where you used to write…\nlibrary(plot2)\nplot2(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length | Species, iris)\n… you should now write:\nlibrary(tinyplot)\ntinyplot(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length | Species, iris)\n\n# Or, use the equivalent shorthand `plt` alias\nplt(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length | Species, iris)\nThe package URLs have been updated accordingly:\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/grantmcdermott/tinyplot\nWebsite: https://grantmcdermott.com/tinyplot\nR-universe: https://grantmcdermott.r-universe.dev/tinyplot\n\nMany thanks to everyone who provided thoughtful feedback about this prospective name change, especially @zeileis and @vincentarelbundock for kicking off the discussion, as well as the 100+ participants who voted in the social media poll.\nFor more details about the rational underlying this renaming decision, please see the following GitHub comment, as well as the discussion that preceded it: https://github.com/grantmcdermott/plot2/issues/22#issuecomment-1928472754\n\n\n\nWebsite:\nWe now have a dedicated website! (#80 @vincentarelbundock)\nNew features:\n\nSupport for cex and bg (alias fill) arguments. The latter also permit the “by” convenience keyword similar to lty and pch. This is useful for plotting filled point characters (e.g., pch = 21), where you want a different colour for the fill and border. (#50, #75 @grantmcdermott)\nSupport for filled density plots. (#58 @grantmcdermott)\nThe new add argument allows new plot2 objects to be added to / on top of the existing plot window. (#60 @grantmcdermott)\nSupport for one-sided formulas, e.g. plot2(~ Temp | Month, airquality). (#62 @grantmcdermott and @zeileis)\nSupport for plot2(x, type = \"density\") as an alternative to plot2(density(x)). Works for both the atomic and one-sided formula methods. (#66 @grantmcdermott)\nSupport for “area” type plots as a special case of ribbon plots. (#68 @grantmcdermott)\nPartial matching for palette keywords. (#74 @grantmcdermott)\nplot2 gains a new facet argument for drawing faceted plots. Users can override the default square arrangement by passing the desired number of facet rows or columns to the companion facet.args helper function. Facets can be combined with by grouping, or used on their own. (#83, #91, #94, #96, #101, #103 @grantmcdermott)\nUsers can now control plot2-specific graphical parameters globally via the new par2() function (which is modeled on the base par() function). At the moment only a subset of global parameters, mostly related to legend and facet behaviour, are exposed in par2. But users can expect that more will be added in future releases. (#33, #94 @grantmcdermott)\n\nBug fixes:\n\nY-label correctly prints if a function was used for the atomic plot method, e.g. plot2(rnorm(100). (#52 etiennebacher)\nRibbon plot types are now automatically ordered by the x variable. (#54 @grantmcdermott)\nInterval plots like ribbons, errorbars, and pointranges are now correctly plotted even if a y variable isn’t specified. (#54 @grantmcdermott)\nCorrectly label date-time axes. (#77 @grantmcdermott and @zeileis)\nImproved consistency of legend and facet margins across different plot types and placement, via the new lmar and fmar arguments of par2(). The default legend margin is par2(lmar = c(1,0, 0.1), which means that there is 1.0 line of padding between the legend and the plot region (inside margin) and 0.1 line of padding between the legend and edge of the graphics device (outer margin). Similarly, the default facet padding is par2(fmar = c(1,1,1,1), which means that there is a single line of padding around each side of the individual facets. Users can override these defaults by passing numeric vectors of the appropriate length to par2(). For example, par2(lmar = c(0,0.1) would shrink the inner gap between the legend and plot region to zero, but leave the small outer gap to outside of the graphics device unchanged.

(#92 @grantmcdermott)\n\n\n\n\nBreaking changes:\n\nColour palettes are now controlled via a single palette argument that unifies the old palette and (deprecated) palette.args arguments. In addition, the default palette for small groups has been changed from “Okabe-Ito” to “R4”. (#31 and #32 @grantmcdermott)\nLegends are now controlled via a single legend argument that unifies the previous (deprecated) legend.position and legend.args arguments. This change also enables several enhancements over the old legend behaviour; see below. (#34 @grantmcdermott)\n\nNew features:\n\nAdd support for the argument log.

    "text": "License:\n\nFormally switch to Apache 2.0 license. (#141 @grantmcdermott)\n\nNew features:\n\nGradient legends are now supported if a continuous variable is passed to by. Thanks to @zeileis for detailed feedback and advice around the default palette choice (a restricted version of the “viridis” palette), as well as StackOverflow user mnel, whose answer here provided the inspiration for the final implementation. (#122 @grantmcdermott)\nOrdered factors now inherit a discrete sequential color palette (“viridis”) by default. Thanks to @zeileis for the suggestion. (#130 @grantmcdermott)\nSupport user-supplied polygons. (#127 @grantmcdermott)\nSupport for the lwd argument for adjusting line widths. Similar to pch, lty, etc. this arguments also accepts a “by” convenience keyword to automatically vary line widths by group. (#134 @grantmcdermott)\ntpar() now accepts standard par() arguments in addition to the tinyplot-specific ones. This allows users to set or query graphical parameters via a single convenience function, instead having to invoke tpar and par separately.\nUsers can write plots directly to disk using the new file argument, alongside corresponding width and height arguments for output customization (both of which are defined in inches). For example, tinyplot(..., file = \"~/myplot.png\", width = 8, height = 5). This implementation relies on a simple internal wrapper around the traditional R external graphics devices like png(), pdf(), etc. But it may prove more convenient, since the current global graphics parameters held in (t)par() are carried over to the external device too and don’t need to be reset. Note that the appropriate device type is determined automatically by the file extension, which must be one of “.png”, “.jpg” (“.jpeg”), “.pdf”, or “.svg”. (#143 @grantmcdermott)\n\nBug fixes:\n\nFixed bug that prevented tpar(facet.x = ...) args from being passed forward and set correctly. (#137 @grantmcdermott)\n\nInternals:\n\nWe no longer ship the vignette(s) with the built package. This helps to reduce the size of the installation tarball and also avoids some redundancy with the actual help documentation (since many of the examples are the same). Note that the vignettes are all still rendered and available online at the tinyplot website. (#135 @grantmcdermott)\nSimilarly, we anticipate skipping tests on CRAN since the large suite of test snapshots (images) held in inst/tinytest is pushing the install tarball over CRAN’s recommended 5 MB limit. Please note that local testing of the package requires adding the NOT_CRAN=TRUE environment variable to your .Renviron file (or, exporting it in your .bashrc/.zshrc/etc. dotfile if you prefer that approach).

    "text": "IMPORTANT BREAKING CHANGE:\nThe package has been renamed to tinyplot. (#22 @grantmcdermott)\nThis package renaming also incorporates the following function changes:\n\nplot2() is replaced by tinyplot() (or its shorthand alias plt()).\npar2() is replaced by tpar().\n\nSo, where you used to write…\nlibrary(plot2)\nplot2(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length | Species, iris)\n… you should now write:\nlibrary(tinyplot)\ntinyplot(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length | Species, iris)\n\n# Or, use the equivalent shorthand `plt` alias\nplt(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length | Species, iris)\nThe package URLs have been updated accordingly:\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/grantmcdermott/tinyplot\nWebsite: https://grantmcdermott.com/tinyplot\nR-universe: https://grantmcdermott.r-universe.dev/tinyplot\n\nMany thanks to everyone who provided thoughtful feedback about this prospective name change, especially @zeileis and @vincentarelbundock for kicking off the discussion, as well as the 100+ participants who voted in the social media poll.\nFor more details about the rational underlying this renaming decision, please see the following GitHub comment, as well as the discussion that preceded it: https://github.com/grantmcdermott/plot2/issues/22#issuecomment-1928472754",

    "text": "Website:\nWe now have a dedicated website! (#80 @vincentarelbundock)\nNew features:\n\nSupport for cex and bg (alias fill) arguments. The latter also permit the “by” convenience keyword similar to lty and pch. This is useful for plotting filled point characters (e.g., pch = 21), where you want a different colour for the fill and border. (#50, #75 @grantmcdermott)\nSupport for filled density plots. (#58 @grantmcdermott)\nThe new add argument allows new plot2 objects to be added to / on top of the existing plot window. (#60 @grantmcdermott)\nSupport for one-sided formulas, e.g. plot2(~ Temp | Month, airquality). (#62 @grantmcdermott and @zeileis)\nSupport for plot2(x, type = \"density\") as an alternative to plot2(density(x)). Works for both the atomic and one-sided formula methods. (#66 @grantmcdermott)\nSupport for “area” type plots as a special case of ribbon plots. (#68 @grantmcdermott)\nPartial matching for palette keywords. (#74 @grantmcdermott)\nplot2 gains a new facet argument for drawing faceted plots. Users can override the default square arrangement by passing the desired number of facet rows or columns to the companion facet.args helper function. Facets can be combined with by grouping, or used on their own. (#83, #91, #94, #96, #101, #103 @grantmcdermott)\nUsers can now control plot2-specific graphical parameters globally via the new par2() function (which is modeled on the base par() function).
